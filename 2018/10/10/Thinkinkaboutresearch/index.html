		  	<h2 id="Discuss-with-research"><a href="#Discuss-with-research" class="headerlink" title="Discuss with research"></a>Discuss with research</h2><p>As an academic skill, research is the vital thing in my study process. In the begin of term, critical thinking and research have been the most important subject. Indeed, research for me was really helpful in the past projects.<br><a id="more"></a><br>I collected othersâ€™ ideas and method to seek possibilities in my own work. Evenmore, research could be a tool that understand othersâ€™ opion or attitude. Thatâ€™s means, a work developed by research, it might be more acceptable, because some parts of it were inspired from existent theories and knowledges.</p>
<p>One of classmates do research by experience and travel real location to feel atmosphere. It would be more sensetive if we go somewhere and observe local objects. Not only take photos, but find out some details in building, environment and human culture. If we want to realize somewhere, it is a good way to stay there, merely do nothing. In my view, doing research not just take notes or sketch something, keeping thinking and being relax could be useful to inspired self.</p>
<p>Another classmates said a question that always confused me that sometimes we usually donâ€™t know <strong>WHY</strong> did we choose some colours in our work. Sometimes, we indeed like do somtings we would like to do, which without reasons. Evenmore, we found more evidence to demonstrate that. Although it could be a way to develop work, it is still not reasonable. As a designer, we should know the reason we choose some layout or colours, it can be logical and linear. So it is important to draft our project, when we have some satisfied scheme, <em>we should do more research and realize why it is good</em>, so we will get more clear mind to develop that. ðŸŒš</p>
<p>Finally, somebody showed her FMP for us. They are some engraving works with gorgeous texture. And she pointed some special texture was created by <strong>ACCIDENT</strong> which made because of something broken. Fortunately, this accident made a really good shape with powerful trace. Charley said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we call it <strong>LUCKY ACCIDENT</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Is it means art need luck? Of course <strong>NO!</strong> The lucky girl said, she used some bad outcome which printed with unsatisfied texture, she developed by cut and refine the outline. She distinguished the quality of work, and did action research, so she could create better work than early one. <strong><em>Face own lose, find the reason than refine that</em></strong> Maybe reason could be the most important thing when we creating work, and research can help us to define the reason we choose.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
