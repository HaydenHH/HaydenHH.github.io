		  	<h1 id="FMP-proposal"><a href="#FMP-proposal" class="headerlink" title="FMP proposal"></a>FMP proposal</h1><p>During early projects in last term and EP&amp;IV which is in progressing, I expanded my techniques on digital-image making and been familiar with more western art genres. As the last project I’m going to complete in my MA study, FMP will be supported by concluding methodologies and theories which I understood from early experiences. In this proposal, early projects and EP&amp;IV will be briefly introduced, and be explained how will it lead the direction of FMP, then the purpose and form of final outcome will be discussed. In the end, the research direction in thesis will be shown.</p>
<p>As a contemporary image maker, I prefer to work with computer and programme. In the first project in the last term, I operated programme to make a web which is <strong>data-driven</strong> and it can generate graphic with Chinese poem. The reason I chose that topic is, I would like <em>improve the communication between Western and Asian culture</em>. Expanding my individual style, I made more experiments on Web techniques, in EP&amp;IV. I explored <strong>Web3D, WebVR, Web server hosting</strong>, which allow me to create new form of media and interaction which give audience unique experience. The content in EP&amp;IV is about relationship in individuals and groups. I collected posts from twitter, <em>analysed the topic, sentiment, age of users which in a specific location</em>. After visualising these data, I can observe their potential relationship. To summary how EP&amp;IV lead my FMP, it can be divided as 3 parts. Firstly, it allow me to <strong>combine art &amp; technology</strong>, during data-driven design, I worked with objective data and subjective visuals, and the balance and relationship in them could been solved well, hence I am really exciting to engage in art &amp; technology together. Secondly, EP&amp;IV inspired me to think about Media &amp; Communication. In the Internet era, big-data can used to analyse the sentiment from texts even facial capture, therefore, new media would <strong>improve the communication by conveying accuracy emotion and feeling</strong>. Thirdly, I explored relational aesthetic during EP&amp;IV. Influences between individuals, groups and environment formed sort of hierarchy which could generate strong visuals, such as <strong>diversity, coherence, restriction</strong> these elements would lead my visual language to express relationship, in my future work.</p>
<p>Considerer the current political and cultural environment, I focused on explore issue of population ageing and diversity of generation in East-Asian area. “<em>The percentage of Chinese above the retirement age is expected to reach 39 percent of the population by 2050</em> (ChinaPower, 2016)”, as this news reported, China will face serious problem on population ageing. Furthermore, influenced by traditional philosophy and   family structure, Chinese or Japanese have appearance diversity on generation, which could affect positive communication or social activities. Hence, when China become the high-level aged society, the <strong>issue of communication in senior cohort</strong> would be serious. In this condition, I would like to explore this issue even suppose solutions, and my key point is media. As I mentioned, new media could improve the expressing of emotion, in addition, media could effect diversity of generation. As Goran said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>generational relations exist between age, geo-political space, cultural environment, as well as media landscape, which be effected by technological development (Goran, 2016). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Medias in different periods changed the method of communication, as well as their diversity, because high-tech media generally improved the <strong>efficiency</strong> of communication. Therefore, the purpose of my FMP, is announce even solve the issue of communication in future senior cohort. The method would be attempting to mixing technology &amp; art and create new media form, such as interaction with computer, VR/AR.</p>
<p>Supporting concepts, thesis will be related to deeper research. It could  be divided as 3 blocks. The first block is about social issues. Reflected current problem, except population ageing, people’s social activities are become exclusionary; and they time becomes fragmented. I’d like to explore the reason of that and the relationship between issues to media. Hence, the second part is about Media. The influence of media in generational diversity, advantages and disadvantages of new media, these points will be discussed in thesis. In the end, I will do researches about Futurism, relational aesthetics or other art genres, and these art theories will be used to support my visualisation.</p>
