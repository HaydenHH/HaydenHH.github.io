		  	<h1 id="Trip-to-tate"><a href="#Trip-to-tate" class="headerlink" title="Trip to tate"></a>Trip to tate</h1><p>In this Friday, we went to the Tate modern museum to catch inspiration. Actually, I visited here twice, but this time is still gave me new ideas even something I didn’t understand.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="atmosphere-of-building"><a href="#atmosphere-of-building" class="headerlink" title="atmosphere of building"></a>atmosphere of building</h2><p>As a famous contemporary museum, Tate modern has a good design at interior design and architecture. We can see a clear structure in this building, and wall paint, sometimes the wall is original so it shows a concrete material or iron. In my view,  it can decrease the attraction of building so viewer can focus more on exhibitions.</p>
<h3 id="A-big-painting-on-ground"><a href="#A-big-painting-on-ground" class="headerlink" title="A big painting on ground"></a>A big painting on ground</h3><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate1.jpg">
<p>I don’t know who is the man painted on ground XD, and I even don’t know it is a painting before I backed to upper floor. It is really big so people stand beside the painting are hard to fully view it. To more specific observe, it is paint as different points with different distance and size, it could be generated by Python or other programme. In the picture I took, there is a child is standing in the work, she might not know she has been surrounded by this art work, but this work indeed effected her. Is it the effect of art? It could be invisible or potential, but it does work.</p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate2.jpg">
<p>As well as atmosphere/ environment, it will not illustrate a specific meaning, but it effect on content and feeling. </p>
<h3 id="Light-and-Dark"><a href="#Light-and-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Light and Dark"></a>Light and Dark</h3><p>The Light &amp; Dark always can be the good tool for artists. It create strong visual to catch focus. </p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate10.jpg">
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate3.jpg">
<p>The motional text with bright light can easily get attention, and the artist used angle and bulb to create a triangle light.</p>
<p>And in this work,</p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate7.jpg">
<p>light generated sort of shadow which have different clarity, so it exhibit the change of hierarchy because of the distance between objects and light source.  </p>
<h3 id="Magic-of-materials"><a href="#Magic-of-materials" class="headerlink" title="Magic of materials"></a>Magic of materials</h3><p>Contemporary artist generally will not be limited by materials, they can show concept through any thing if it is possible. </p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate8.jpg">
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate9.jpg">
<p>I saw the upper one as a piece of soil which be lifted, so it could be understood as the remove of soil, and the conflict between nature and human. </p>
<p>Materials can take directly feeling which can guide viewer to associate with relative expression. Furthermore, it can combine with graphic language to improve visual effect.</p>
<h1 id="history-of-art"><a href="#history-of-art" class="headerlink" title="history of art"></a>history of art</h1><p>After trip in Tate, I joint a lecture which speak by Ben. He briefly talked about history of art. As a designer, I must admit I have not enough interests in fine arts and classical art. But I do like expressionism or abstractionism. </p>
<h2 id="the-progress-of-art"><a href="#the-progress-of-art" class="headerlink" title="the progress of art"></a>the progress of art</h2><p>Does idea being more important in art? Review the history of art, ideas and concepts look take more parts in an art work, some artist even gave traditional methods up to show their idea. </p>
<p>As a part of culture, art can be seen as the tool which convey ideology and attitude, so public require art become more expressive, especially during a war.</p>
<h2 id="Does-art-influence-a-War"><a href="#Does-art-influence-a-War" class="headerlink" title="Does art influence a War"></a>Does art influence a War</h2><p>The art work after war could be more popular for a collector, cause we can clear see the influence of war to the artist or society. But, can we find some work which <strong>effect</strong> a war? We see, some style such as Dada / Pop art, are influenced by war, they could be the result of war.</p>
<p>Futurism was popular in early 20th Centry Italy, it focus on expression of speed/ motion/ machine/ industry, in my view, it promote the increase of materialism in Italy.</p>
