<h2 id="Steps-to-print"><a href="#Steps-to-print" class="headerlink" title="Steps to print"></a>Steps to print</h2><ul>
<li><p>The first step is clear the table and prepare a <strong>laysheet</strong>. That’s the paper we would print as outcome. And we must bring <strong>original work</strong>. We should place the original work to comfirm the position we print on laysheet. So we paste work (it generally is acid paper) Fixed by tape. Than we fix film board on print machine so it hard to move. A little tip is fold a paper and paste on laysheet, so it is available to move and adjust to a right position though the sheet will be covered by film board.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ink should be adjust to be wet and smooth that’s means it will not dry too quick. To confect (调制) a good quality ink, we should balance the ratio of <strong>acrylic medium</strong> and <strong>acrylic</strong>. Medium should be put into container at first, because it can available acrylic mixed completely. <strong>50%</strong> medium and about 10g acrylic, and tiny other colours if we nee d mixed colour. <del>其实就挤三四陀就好了。</del> </p>
</li>
<li><p>To print well, we should print ink equality, <strong>DO NOT</strong> print overly, it lose all of details of engraving. The most important thing is that if we print a multicolour work, the position of laysheet should be accuracy place. We use first work that took mark with laystops to  guarantee that. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-use-screen-printing"><a href="#Why-use-screen-printing" class="headerlink" title="Why use screen printing?"></a>Why use screen printing?</h2><p>Screen printing is a technique that print something have original details. Though it could print repeatedly, every times printing with different speeds or force might make different effect. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the making of film board could be hand drawn that’s means some hand drawn illustrations can be use as film, and print to different colors. Different with digital creation, the process of making film could have tiny differences between original painting, so it will full of unpredictable details that really gorgeous for me.</p>

In the begin of term, critical thinking and research have been the most important subject. Indeed, research for me was really helpful in the past projects.<br><a id="more"></a><br>I collected others’ ideas and method to seek possibilities in my own work. Evenmore, research could be a tool that understand others’ opion or attitude. That’s means, a work developed by research, it might be more acceptable, because some parts of it were inspired from existent theories and knowledges.</p>
<p>One of classmates do research by experience and travel real location to feel atmosphere. It would be more sensetive if we go somewhere and observe local objects. Not only take photos, but find out some details in building, environment and human culture. If we want to realize somewhere, it is a good way to stay there, merely do nothing. In my view, doing research not just take notes or sketch something, keeping thinking and being relax could be useful to inspired self.</p>
<p>Another classmates said a question that always confused me that sometimes we usually don’t know <strong>WHY</strong> did we choose some colours in our work. Sometimes, we indeed like do somtings we would like to do, which without reasons. Evenmore, we found more evidence to demonstrate that. Although it could be a way to develop work, it is still not reasonable. As a designer, we should know the reason we choose some layout or colours, it can be logical and linear. So it is important to draft our project, when we have some satisfied scheme, <em>we should do more research and realize why it is good</em>, so we will get more clear mind to develop that. 🌚</p>
<p>Finally, somebody showed her FMP for us. They are some engraving works with gorgeous texture. And she pointed some special texture was created by <strong>ACCIDENT</strong> which made because of something broken. Fortunately, this accident made a really good shape with powerful trace. Charley said, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>we call it <strong>LUCKY ACCIDENT</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>😂😂😂 Is it means art need luck? Of course <strong>NO!</strong> The lucky girl said, she used some bad outcome which printed with unsatisfied texture, she developed by cut and refine the outline. She distinguished the quality of work, and did action research, so she could create better work than early one. <strong><em>Face own lose, find the reason than refine that</em></strong> Maybe reason could be the most important thing when we creating work, and research can help us to define the reason we choose.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
