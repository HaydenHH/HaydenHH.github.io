<p>The early topic we chose is about relationship in contemporary partner. </p>

<p>Because of the culture shock, emotion between different people could be hard to understand by other who from different countries. Therefore we are going to focus more on <em>behaviour</em> side, which means, in the animation, the <em>emotion</em> expression could not be rendered as main point, the <strong>phenomenon</strong> and <strong>behaviour</strong> will be more important in this project. </p>
<h2 id="Reason-I-explore-relationship-between-partner"><a href="#Reason-I-explore-relationship-between-partner" class="headerlink" title="Reason I explore relationship between partner"></a>Reason I explore relationship between partner</h2><p>There are many developed countries are holding a low population growth, evermore negative growth. In my opinion, this phenomenon is because of the change of <strong>marry</strong>. Children and children education is becoming kind of <strong>bear</strong> in a family especially in high-knowledge level group. More and more partner have strong individual concept, and they are becoming more <strong>independent</strong>.<br>So I want to explore the reason people become more independent with partner, it could be include the physical factors or emotional reason. </p>

In the time, they will have different attitude to these sub-production as well as paintings. In today’s workshop, my peers created some experiments to express the process of misunderstanding and <strong>distortion</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="repeat-photocopy"><a href="#repeat-photocopy" class="headerlink" title="repeat photocopy"></a>repeat photocopy</h3><p>Photocopy a painting with 10 times, what does it look like? Digitally, pixel will increase, so it will lose details and sharpness. Furthermore, the colours will change to be more bright which have higher saturation. Fine lines will become bolder and look as if they’ve been <strong>engrave</strong> , because of lines look like rise up, and generate bigger contrast with background, so it has an engrave-alike texture.</p>
<h3 id="de-adjective"><a href="#de-adjective" class="headerlink" title="de-adjective"></a>de-adjective</h3><p>People generally describe and understand object through read adjective. A peer removed most adjectives in a text which describe the girl with pearl earring. Then she found it look as if it is describing Mona Lisa. It shows the influence of second-hand cognition, people will easily change the attitude because of different descriptions. So I thought we can see something in different angle, a general sight and illustratively.</p>

To summary, this Web is designed to devote translate words to graphic information. The content I used is Chinese classical poem, I catched poem by JSON which be supported by <a href="https://gushi.ci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gushi.ci</a>. <a id="more"></a>Therefore, user can get massive poem randomly, and they can try to understand it by graphic as well as the translation supported by Baidu’s API. Now, I’m going to conclude some problem I faced, and the final solution.</p>
<h2 id="use-Javascript-module-to-create-elements-in-time"><a href="#use-Javascript-module-to-create-elements-in-time" class="headerlink" title="use Javascript module to create elements in time."></a>use Javascript module to create elements in time.</h2><p>The target is showing a gallery on Web, there are many of image had been upload on cloud server, and display by <strong>href Link</strong>. I collected all of link in JSON file, and the Web can read link than create elements.</p>
<h3 id="module-style-and-Event"><a href="#module-style-and-Event" class="headerlink" title="module style and Event"></a>module style and Event</h3><p>As ECMA6 declared:</p>
<pre><code>$(&#39;body&#39;).append(`
    &lt;p&gt;Content:${Variable}&lt;/p&gt;
`)
</code></pre><p>` (反引号) this symbol can include string and <strong>variable</strong>, which means it is easy to create module and generate elements on HTML.<br>The question is I should add event listener to elements for motion and interaction. After every new generations, I added event listener repeatedly, which means when user interact with that element, it will response many times! The original method is:</p>
<pre><code>Array.from(.elements).forEach((t)=&gt;{
    t.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;,function(){
        ...
    })
}) 
</code></pre><p>To add <strong>EL</strong> for every elements, I chose a <strong>class</strong>, and set to an <strong>Array</strong>, so it can use forEach() to <strong>iterate</strong> (遍历). <strong>But</strong>, the existed elements will be added EL again, which is horrible..So I changed the method of add, I chose the last element which is <strong>the last generated</strong>, and add EL for it. The important thing is <strong>Selector</strong>. </p>
<p>The SVG object can be chosen by CSS selector or DOM selector, so I would like to set attribute of SVG by <strong>Anime.js</strong> </p>
<pre><code>let cir = svg.paper.circle(x,y,r) //create circle element
cir.attr({
    class:&#39;.cir-in-svg&#39;
}) // set class so it can be chosen by CSS/Anime

anime({
    targets:&#39;.cir-in-svg&#39;,
    translateX:[
        {values:100,duration:1000,easing:&#39;linear&#39;},
        {values:0,duration:1000,easing:&#39;linear&#39;}            
    ],
    opacity:1,
    duration:function(el,i,l){
        return 500 + i*100  // el=targets,i=index,l=length
    }
})
</code></pre><p>SVG can be set by CSS with a good performance and interactivity.  So in future work, my main direction will be vector graphic and interactive animation.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-random-item-from-existed-Array"><a href="#add-a-random-item-from-existed-Array" class="headerlink" title="add a random item from existed Array"></a>add a random item from existed Array</h3><p>This is a really usually requirement in WEB application, users could load more elements in time, but if every times they click and see <strong>same</strong> arrangement, there will not be cool. <code>There is a simple solution: create a new array, **random** select an element and push to new Array, then return the new one</code>, I thought. That’s wrong. Because it will add repeat elements, if randomly choose. So, the new solution is use Set type which declared by ECMA6, it like Array, can be iterated by for(..of..) The most important thing is : <strong>Set can not save same element</strong></p>
<pre><code>const originArr = [a,b,c,d,e]
let ranSet = new Set()

do {
    ranSet.add(originArr[Math.floor(Math.random() * originArr.length)])
} while (ranSet.size&lt;5);

let    newArr = Array.from(ranSet)
</code></pre><p>So, the newArray is the new Array which is absolutely random.</p>

After 5 days, I basically understood the using of p5.js 😃, so I continually refine the idea about visualisation of CC (Chinese Character). To definitely show the differences of characters, I chose Strokes counts to generate points and lines. In this article I will describe most progress and details....</p>
