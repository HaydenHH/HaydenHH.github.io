<p>This work shows a group of symbols. Although they look irregular, actually they are made by strict algorithms that means computer render them by a specific programmer or ruler. This work can be remade thousands times without once completely same group, but they are made with same <strong>visual language </strong>. The key point in this work is <strong> variable </strong> which means the work base on essential elements, and they grouped with random way, because of variable.</p>
<p>The reason I appreciate this work is, variable available us to create a work which can be dynamic and random. It can convey multiple emotions and information, because different users might have individual information, so a dynamic work could bring more specific feelings.</p>
<p>This work is made by circles and poly line, they order by algorithm and changed with variable. It shows a strong visual, but it has supported more specific information, that means it merely show graphic and regular, rather then represent a emotion or story. It is only shape. Therefore, in my work, I would like to draw more informative graphic which might show more potential feeling.</p>

Creation could <strong>constructed by original things</strong>, the important thing is to get <strong>existed thing</strong> to built new up. <a id="more"></a> Therefore, it is vital to do research for a designer. Research is a way to find new idea, though it might be created by others, but as designer, we can translate the idea to own. Furthermore, it is necessary to collect evidence and theories to prove own work.</p>
<h2 id="Research-can-be-enjoyable"><a href="#Research-can-be-enjoyable" class="headerlink" title="Research can be enjoyable"></a>Research can be enjoyable</h2><p>In research seminar, two designers showed their idea about research and method to achieve a good development of work. But the important thing for me is, how to keep a positive attitude to do research, which means we should <strong>enjoy</strong> the process of research rather then complete an assignment. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/fiona_grady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiona</a> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the research in social media can improve the confidence of artists because they can get constructive feedback and gain more friends which have same interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, do research on social media could not be a good idea because I generally be attracted by other things. The point I absolutely agree is that we should gain confidence and pleasure in the process of research. It might improve my <strong>ambition</strong> to realise new things or accept something I hadn’t agreed or understood. </p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-do-research-in-a-happy-experience"><a href="#how-do-we-do-research-in-a-happy-experience" class="headerlink" title="how do we do research in a happy experience?"></a>how do we do research in a happy experience?</h2><p>It’s no doubt that people always glad to do something might make self <strong>happy </strong>. To make self be happy, we should focus on something we interested. Unfortunately, sometimes the topic of subject could not the favourite one, even some theories are serious and boring. <em>how can we change the attitude and be more excited in process of research?</em>  In my view, the key is <strong>synchronise with experiment</strong>. That’s means, when we are doing  research, we should do some experiments and sketch or mind-map, so we can see the process of our thinking and understanding, we might get clear understanding, and it the <strong>result or outcome</strong> could make us be more confident, rather then a dozen of paper, so boring, isn’t it.</p>

<p>We had reaped the rewards of what art historian Jennifer Roberts has called<strong>“deceleration, patience and immersive attention.”</strong>1 To her students at Harvard, Roberts assigned the task of spending three whole hours in front of the John Singleton Copley painting Boy with a Squirrel. It was an exercise that Roberts herself had performed in her study of the painting, an act of temporal largesse that had yielded insights not readily available in any single passing look. <em>Ventura( 2016) Slow Criticism: Art in the Age of Post-Judgement</em></p>
