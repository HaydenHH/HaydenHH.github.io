Actually, I visited here twice, but this time is still gave me new ideas even something I didn’t understand.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<h2 id="atmosphere-of-building"><a href="#atmosphere-of-building" class="headerlink" title="atmosphere of building"></a>atmosphere of building</h2><p>As a famous contemporary museum, Tate modern has a good design at interior design and architecture. We can see a clear structure in this building, and wall paint, sometimes the wall is original so it shows a concrete material or iron. In my view,  it can decrease the attraction of building so viewer can focus more on exhibitions.</p>
<h3 id="A-big-painting-on-ground"><a href="#A-big-painting-on-ground" class="headerlink" title="A big painting on ground"></a>A big painting on ground</h3><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate1.jpg">
<p>I don’t know who is the man painted on ground XD, and I even don’t know it is a painting before I backed to upper floor. It is really big so people stand beside the painting are hard to fully view it. To more specific observe, it is paint as different points with different distance and size, it could be generated by Python or other programme. In the picture I took, there is a child is standing in the work, she might not know she has been surrounded by this art work, but this work indeed effected her. Is it the effect of art? It could be invisible or potential, but it does work.</p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate2.jpg">
<p>As well as atmosphere/ environment, it will not illustrate a specific meaning, but it effect on content and feeling. </p>
<h3 id="Light-and-Dark"><a href="#Light-and-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Light and Dark"></a>Light and Dark</h3><p>The Light &amp; Dark always can be the good tool for artists. It create strong visual to catch focus. </p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate10.jpg">
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate3.jpg">
<p>The motional text with bright light can easily get attention, and the artist used angle and bulb to create a triangle light.</p>
<p>And in this work,</p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate7.jpg">
<p>light generated sort of shadow which have different clarity, so it exhibit the change of hierarchy because of the distance between objects and light source.  </p>
<h3 id="Magic-of-materials"><a href="#Magic-of-materials" class="headerlink" title="Magic of materials"></a>Magic of materials</h3><p>Contemporary artist generally will not be limited by materials, they can show concept through any thing if it is possible. </p>
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate8.jpg">
<img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate9.jpg">
<p>I saw the upper one as a piece of soil which be lifted, so it could be understood as the remove of soil, and the conflict between nature and human. </p>
<p>Materials can take directly feeling which can guide viewer to associate with relative expression. Furthermore, it can combine with graphic language to improve visual effect.</p>
<h1 id="history-of-art"><a href="#history-of-art" class="headerlink" title="history of art"></a>history of art</h1><p>After trip in Tate, I joint a lecture which speak by Ben. He briefly talked about history of art. As a designer, I must admit I have not enough interests in fine arts and classical art. But I do like expressionism or abstractionism. </p>
<h2 id="the-progress-of-art"><a href="#the-progress-of-art" class="headerlink" title="the progress of art"></a>the progress of art</h2><p>Does idea being more important in art? Review the history of art, ideas and concepts look take more parts in an art work, some artist even gave traditional methods up to show their idea. </p>
<p>As a part of culture, art can be seen as the tool which convey ideology and attitude, so public require art become more expressive, especially during a war.</p>
<h2 id="Does-art-influence-a-War"><a href="#Does-art-influence-a-War" class="headerlink" title="Does art influence a War"></a>Does art influence a War</h2><p>The art work after war could be more popular for a collector, cause we can clear see the influence of war to the artist or society. But, can we find some work which <strong>effect</strong> a war? We see, some style such as Dada / Pop art, are influenced by war, they could be the result of war.</p>
<p>Futurism was popular in early 20th Centry Italy, it focus on expression of speed/ motion/ machine/ industry, in my view, it promote the increase of materialism in Italy.</p>

<p>The early topic we chose is about relationship in contemporary partner. </p>

<p>Because of the culture shock, emotion between different people could be hard to understand by other who from different countries. Therefore we are going to focus more on <em>behaviour</em> side, which means, in the animation, the <em>emotion</em> expression could not be rendered as main point, the <strong>phenomenon</strong> and <strong>behaviour</strong> will be more important in this project. </p>
<h2 id="Reason-I-explore-relationship-between-partner"><a href="#Reason-I-explore-relationship-between-partner" class="headerlink" title="Reason I explore relationship between partner"></a>Reason I explore relationship between partner</h2><p>There are many developed countries are holding a low population growth, evermore negative growth. In my opinion, this phenomenon is because of the change of <strong>marry</strong>. Children and children education is becoming kind of <strong>bear</strong> in a family especially in high-knowledge level group. More and more partner have strong individual concept, and they are becoming more <strong>independent</strong>.<br>So I want to explore the reason people become more independent with partner, it could be include the physical factors or emotional reason. </p>

<h2 id="infinite-reproduce-infinite-misunderstanding"><a href="#infinite-reproduce-infinite-misunderstanding" class="headerlink" title="infinite reproduce, infinite misunderstanding"></a>infinite reproduce, infinite misunderstanding</h2><p>As a significant count of reproduction have been made in market, audiences have a high cognition to some classical art work. In the time, they will have different attitude to these sub-production as well as paintings. In today’s workshop, my peers created some experiments to express the process of misunderstanding and <strong>distortion</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="repeat-photocopy"><a href="#repeat-photocopy" class="headerlink" title="repeat photocopy"></a>repeat photocopy</h3><p>Photocopy a painting with 10 times, what does it look like? Digitally, pixel will increase, so it will lose details and sharpness. Furthermore, the colours will change to be more bright which have higher saturation. Fine lines will become bolder and look as if they’ve been <strong>engrave</strong> , because of lines look like rise up, and generate bigger contrast with background, so it has an engrave-alike texture.</p>
<h3 id="de-adjective"><a href="#de-adjective" class="headerlink" title="de-adjective"></a>de-adjective</h3><p>People generally describe and understand object through read adjective. A peer removed most adjectives in a text which describe the girl with pearl earring. Then she found it look as if it is describing Mona Lisa. It shows the influence of second-hand cognition, people will easily change the attitude because of different descriptions. So I thought we can see something in different angle, a general sight and illustratively.</p>

To summary, this Web is designed to devote translate words to graphic information. The content I used is Chinese classical poem, I catched poem by JSON which be supported by <a href="https://gushi.ci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gushi.ci</a>. <a id="more"></a>Therefore, user can get massive poem randomly, and they can try to understand it by graphic as well as the translation supported by Baidu’s API. Now, I’m going to conclude some problem I faced, and the final solution.</p>
<h2 id="use-Javascript-module-to-create-elements-in-time"><a href="#use-Javascript-module-to-create-elements-in-time" class="headerlink" title="use Javascript module to create elements in time."></a>use Javascript module to create elements in time.</h2><p>The target is showing a gallery on Web, there are many of image had been upload on cloud server, and display by <strong>href Link</strong>. I collected all of link in JSON file, and the Web can read link than create elements.</p>
<h3 id="module-style-and-Event"><a href="#module-style-and-Event" class="headerlink" title="module style and Event"></a>module style and Event</h3><p>As ECMA6 declared:</p>
<pre><code>$(&apos;body&apos;).append(`
    &lt;p&gt;Content:${Variable}&lt;/p&gt;
`)
</code></pre><p>` (反引号) this symbol can include string and <strong>variable</strong>, which means it is easy to create module and generate elements on HTML.<br>The question is I should add event listener to elements for motion and interaction. After every new generations, I added event listener repeatedly, which means when user interact with that element, it will response many times! The original method is:</p>
<pre><code>Array.from(.elements).forEach((t)=&gt;{
    t.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;,function(){
        ...
    })
}) 
</code></pre><p>To add <strong>EL</strong> for every elements, I chose a <strong>class</strong>, and set to an <strong>Array</strong>, so it can use forEach() to <strong>iterate</strong> (遍历). <strong>But</strong>, the existed elements will be added EL again, which is horrible..So I changed the method of add, I chose the last element which is <strong>the last generated</strong>, and add EL for it. The important thing is <strong>Selector</strong>. </p>
<p>The SVG object can be chosen by CSS selector or DOM selector, so I would like to set attribute of SVG by <strong>Anime.js</strong> </p>
<pre><code>let cir = svg.paper.circle(x,y,r) //create circle element
cir.attr({
    class:&apos;.cir-in-svg&apos;
}) // set class so it can be chosen by CSS/Anime

anime({
    targets:&apos;.cir-in-svg&apos;,
    translateX:[
        {values:100,duration:1000,easing:&apos;linear&apos;},
        {values:0,duration:1000,easing:&apos;linear&apos;}            
    ],
    opacity:1,
    duration:function(el,i,l){
        return 500 + i*100  // el=targets,i=index,l=length
    }
})
</code></pre><p>SVG can be set by CSS with a good performance and interactivity.  So in future work, my main direction will be vector graphic and interactive animation.</p>
<h3 id="add-a-random-item-from-existed-Array"><a href="#add-a-random-item-from-existed-Array" class="headerlink" title="add a random item from existed Array"></a>add a random item from existed Array</h3><p>This is a really usually requirement in WEB application, users could load more elements in time, but if every times they click and see <strong>same</strong> arrangement, there will not be cool. <code>There is a simple solution: create a new array, **random** select an element and push to new Array, then return the new one</code>, I thought. That’s wrong. Because it will add repeat elements, if randomly choose. So, the new solution is use Set type which declared by ECMA6, it like Array, can be iterated by for(..of..) The most important thing is : <strong>Set can not save same element</strong></p>
<pre><code>const originArr = [a,b,c,d,e]
let ranSet = new Set()

do {
    ranSet.add(originArr[Math.floor(Math.random() * originArr.length)])
} while (ranSet.size&lt;5);

let    newArr = Array.from(ranSet)
</code></pre><p>So, the newArray is the new Array which is absolutely random.</p>
