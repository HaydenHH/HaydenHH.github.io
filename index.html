                <span ><p>During this week, I’ve complete a whole plan to show all of this project. As the main point I want to show, external factor like environment, atmosphere or other person would affect individual emotion. As also, individual emotion could influence externals as well. Especially, potential expression could hurt others in some situation like apathy, ignoring, libel, etc… Hence, I have a strong motivation to show this point. <em>reveal the influence of emotion, see what emotion shows</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/1zl6oZJCY7FsugW.jpg" alt="未命名作品.jpg"></p>
<p>like this sketch, others’ attitude could make individual be different and strange. Besides, it could be seen as kind of <strong>discrimination</strong>. Though the expression could be invisible and weak, it would affect and hurt other.</p>
<h2 id="Web-construction"><a href="#Web-construction" class="headerlink" title="Web construction"></a>Web construction</h2><p>The basic process of browsing would like this: </p>
<p>User see some scene with varying elements or lighting （looks weird), so character wants to explore why this world is changing. He goes into a factory, and produce sort of <strong>factors</strong> which can effect environment and generate elements with personal expression or other information. Then he can go to  gallery, garden, Computer room to see some scenes he could effect.</p>
<p>So, there are some scenes could appear in web</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction </li>
<li>Emotion factory</li>
<li>Computer room</li>
<li>Gallery</li>
<li>Garden</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Factory-sketches"><a href="#Factory-sketches" class="headerlink" title="Factory sketches"></a>Factory sketches</h3><p>For rendering an intensive and serious (even horror) feeling, I’d like use dark, close space to show the factory scene. And couple of sketches indicate how <strong>emotion factor</strong> be produced.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/qPHWuUxasgLbOpB.jpg" alt="未命名作品.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/CfYbcZyvA79WqF2.jpg" alt="未命名作品 1.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/WQaPX1fBJeS6ltb.jpg" alt="未命名作品 2.jpg"></p>
<p>Lighting is important in this scene, hence I used <strong>BloomEffect</strong> to enhance lighting in Web.</p>
<h3 id="Emotion-factors"><a href="#Emotion-factors" class="headerlink" title="Emotion factors"></a>Emotion factors</h3><p>Each factor would be different, and it could represent the emotion of user in a moment. Effected by various element like temperature, lighting, sentiments, the graphic on ‘factor’ will be generated as mixed style and colours. I painted some sketched to explore the method of generation.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/vCiyTfDANQtUZ3E.jpg" alt="未命名作品 4.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/3uOEkCvhZSYB459.jpg" alt="未命名作品 3.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/2hAM5BqD6wnecIz.jpg" alt="未命名作品 2.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/6t4wxzlJUbkjQZY.jpg" alt="未命名作品 1.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/nE2B6TIwCFDM8O3.jpg" alt="未命名作品.jpg"></p>
<p>After generation, these pattern will used in other scene as the influence of viewer to the scene.</p>
<h2 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem"></a>Problem</h2><p>There is an issue for me, as I said I will use couple of scenes in project and viewer will brows them in order. However, they are hard to organisation. <em>How camera move into other scene?</em> At the technical point, it is difficult to create coherent connection between different scene. Besides, user need enough motivation to encourage he continue watching and interact. For me, if I am a visitor, sometimes I would not do complicated operation in an exhibition work. ( Afraid to damage it ) Therefore, the connection should be <strong>automatic</strong>, so even nobody interact with, it can play whole process.</p>
<h2 id="Style"><a href="#Style" class="headerlink" title="Style"></a>Style</h2><p>In my painting progress, I found some stroke / texture and organic outline has really strong visual effect. In my early programming, most of visual on Web is <strong>Pure vector</strong>, so the visual look simple and little boring. In future development, there’s required to add more bitmap / hand-draw elements on objects.</p>
<h2 id="Next-step"><a href="#Next-step" class="headerlink" title="Next step"></a>Next step</h2><p>Completing all of scene draftily is important, so I can preview the whole process of browsing.</p>

                <span ><h2 id="what-Ive-done"><a href="#what-Ive-done" class="headerlink" title="what Ive done"></a>what Ive done</h2><p>In early process, I’ve fulfilled the technic of <strong>detection</strong> of  facial expression and engage it to drive graphic generation. However, the detection of facial-expression has a high frequency which reach least once/0.7s hence, the generation of graphic will consume huge of performance and would make lagging in future development. So I changed method in many times to expect a more smooth effect.</p>
<h3 id="programming"><a href="#programming" class="headerlink" title="programming"></a>programming</h3><p>The first changing is, I used 3D visual as main element in Web. Supported by WebGL, 3D element can be rendered with higher frequency in Web, so it can be more dynamic, and user can better realise the effecting of emotion. </p>
<p>Secondly, I make emotional data influence lighting in 3d scene rather than directly effect on graphic. Hence the atmosphere can be showed with effected by sentiments.</p>
<p>Thirdly, 3d animation was using in webpage. A interactive 3D animation would be attractive.</p>
<h3 id="painting"><a href="#painting" class="headerlink" title="painting"></a>painting</h3><p>To plan the composition of 3D element, I painted some sketches. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/2ivEkUcWlHos9Jz.jpg" alt="IMG_1607.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/V7gcuPjUOSzXT9s.jpg" alt="IMG_1609.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/10/29/wupc98D4LkZtYM2.jpg" alt="IMG_1608.jpg"></p>
<p>In this idea, boxes are mapped with hand-draw style texture or some mixed-colour graphics, so each box can display different feeling. Besides, this style would make work attract more young viewer, the orthographical view is popular in Web which can show all of elements with same perspective so viewer can better focus on each individuals.</p>
<h2 id="Nice-amp-Bad"><a href="#Nice-amp-Bad" class="headerlink" title="Nice &amp; Bad"></a>Nice &amp; Bad</h2><h3 id="good-interaction"><a href="#good-interaction" class="headerlink" title="good interaction"></a>good interaction</h3><p>3D is good for interaction on Web, user can control sight and distance by mouse, and they can affect visuals by their facial expression during I wrote face detection programming. So in this project viewer can interact with most of elements. Not only the hand activity, but also the facial expression would influence visuals, hence it access kind of abstract interaction.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-generation"><a href="#dynamic-generation" class="headerlink" title="dynamic generation"></a>dynamic generation</h3><p>Most of element would be different because the factor of them is base on real-time data capture. </p>
<h3 id="bad-interface"><a href="#bad-interface" class="headerlink" title="bad interface"></a>bad interface</h3><p>Because there are some function should be controlled by user, user interface is pretty ‘busy’ and uncomfortable so far. Furthermore, the main style of GUI has not been ensured, is it be stylish? warm? abstract or real-looking? </p>
<h3 id="bad-introduction"><a href="#bad-introduction" class="headerlink" title="bad introduction"></a>bad introduction</h3><p>As a Web and interactive application, this work must introduce user <strong>how</strong> they control or affect elements. Hence there is a serious problem, how I introduce user or encourage them to interact with these scene in this project. </p>
<h2 id="Next-step"><a href="#Next-step" class="headerlink" title="Next step"></a>Next step</h2><ol>
<li>design better GUI</li>
<li>think about <strong>introduction</strong> and <strong>motivation</strong> which user would like to explore whole scenes.</li>
<li>order of scenes</li>
</ol>

                <span ><p>In past research, I found a traction artist generally seek kind of abstract expression. ‘Art as the expression’, this sentence could essentially explain what is art, and it have been agreed by most art students / practicers in my research. However, the reality which is showed in art has strong division. Whatever the content is expressed, artists should focus on the reality as it can make sense for viewers.</p>
<p>Reality can be defined as <strong>Natural reality</strong> and <strong>Abstract reality</strong>. The natural reality would be easier to achieve, it represent the figure of objects. When artists paint perfect shape, colors and shadow of object, they close the natural reality. It could be concluded as that, natural reality is what people can see. However, an absolute natural reality would be also meaningless, because it merely show the external element of objects，there are no additional expression in painting. As a viewer, a perfect real painting could make me remember some experience but there would not any more emotion it convey me.<br>In Hyperrealism works, natural realities such as material, texture would be enhanced as artists’ subjective conception. In Magical -realism, artists compose actual elements to be unreal. </p>
<p>In Impressionism, reality be defined as <em>what did I see</em>, there is a changing in process of art. Imageries in mind are conveyed by abstract reality. Artists would enhance the imagery they saw, hence the most attractive point will be showed which might make most intense impression. In post-Impressionism or Symbolism,  the reality artist seek had varied to express ‘How I observe objects’, which means the feeling and reaction is the main point would be expressed in painting. </p>

                <span ><h1 id="City-Upon-Cities"><a href="#City-Upon-Cities" class="headerlink" title="City Upon Cities"></a>City Upon Cities</h1><p>British is actually an country which has appearance <strong>level division</strong> in society. People live different area which could represent their <strong>material standard</strong>. This phenomenon is definitely exist in each countries, but it does more serious in London.</p>
<p><strong>Class struggle</strong> was not fresh since some revolutions in about 1840. People want to get more fair class in society, so they want to execute capitalists and rich man by violent force as the method of protest had been failure. Why people and society against capitalism in that context? If we review the process of capitalism development, we see capitalist must get original means, which could be money, resource, labour force. In this process of <strong>collection</strong>, the value of mean changed, and the class of person changed. After the completion of collection of original means, the structure of class in society would not change easily, because people who have more means will use their energy to grab more worth over and over again.When they can’t get anymore from nature, they begin invade and rob other people’s. Today, in advanced society, capitalism can support most people to share this worth and profits, but the class division still exist, as <strong>exploitation</strong> as well, though the target have been changed, they began to grab means from other countries. </p>
<p>Our city was built upon other cities, towns or countrysides. We can’t say it is unfair, it seems is necessary during the social expand. We can see this progress as the combination of groups. Individuals concentrate as groups, but can groups concentrate as bigger group? What’s the relationship between each groups.</p>
<h2 id="class-in-a-city"><a href="#class-in-a-city" class="headerlink" title="class in a city"></a>class in a city</h2><p>In EP&amp;IV project, I used Web to build a city. To show the <strong>class division</strong>, I stacked multiple platform to represent different class in a city. </p>
<p>The first floor is represent <strong>capitalism</strong> and <strong>money</strong>, which means our life could be led by money and materials. Simply say, we are both desire better life, and the standard of life generally be symbolised by physical means. So people work for higher salaries, company developed for larger market, and government promoted new policy for sustainable sustainable profits. Materials are definitely influence our life. Second floor is politics, and third floor is represent religion. As social creature, human must concentrate together and convert into a part of group. The social structure today, basically is vertical, which means it has strong division on class, the person who controlled politics and religion, he has more right and influences. </p>

<h2 id="why-I-think-about-class"><a href="#why-I-think-about-class" class="headerlink" title="why I think about class"></a>why I think about class</h2><p>The people have more power and right are easily ignore the people live in base, and they might even don’t understand or imagine what the situation of poor people live in. Though we can think other’s life doesn’t be relative with us, and it doesn’t matter about own, but is it true? If we review the early period of capitalism development, we see the collection of means is selfish, violent even brutal. The first group of capitalists earned money by exploiting. Until today, many companies force staff work over time without extra salary, some factories decrease profits of staff to save cost. In advanced countries, they send manufacture to developing countries because the people live in poor region generally need more less salary. In China, even the high-tech industry like IT, medicine, has serious problem on <strong>labour exploitation</strong>. <strong>996</strong> is a popular word which be focused recently in Internet in China. The meaning of 996 is, begin work at 9am, finish at 9pm, 6 days a week. This work model is high-stress for staff, they can’t get fair pay after they work over time. Even the leader of company like ALIBABA, JINGDONG, said this model is <strong>valuable, profitable</strong> for staff, and they exchange the concept of working overtime, they equal overtime to hard-working and struggle. It is really bad, the capitalists  even try to lie and blame staff, like say, you are not hardworking because you not work overtime. It definitely is exploitation in contemporary society, in capitalism. The horrible thing is, IT workers are richer and basically have higher education, so they generally have larger voice in society. Even this, they were exploited. How does poor person, who know their suffering? How they pour out, who can listen them? It is horrible, if we don’t care base people. Our current life, material could be earned from a poor person, who was exploited. We can’t  change the structure of society, but we should care more about these people poor than us, because we could live on their stress.</p>

                <span ><h1 id="Thinking-about-Futurism"><a href="#Thinking-about-Futurism" class="headerlink" title="Thinking about Futurism"></a>Thinking about Futurism</h1><p>For my FMP, I focused on the influence of <strong>technology</strong> on art,  hence I’m going to collect more research about <strong>Futurism</strong>. Futurism was popular from early 20 century, which be influenced by the development of technology and industry. </p>
<h2 id="How-artist-look-through-new-technology"><a href="#How-artist-look-through-new-technology" class="headerlink" title="How artist look through new technology"></a>How artist look through new technology</h2><p>Industry evolution introduced human go into a new era, it also inspired artist to think about some completely new elements which just pop-up in public sight, such as machine, building, sounds from <strong>unnatural</strong>. </p>
<p>Before futurism was popular, the most famous genre could be expressionism. Expressionism artist like to use emotional brush and sensitive colors to express their feeling. As well as <strong>Cubism</strong>, artist began to think objects with different way, or they divided object and reconstruct them. These genre showed the method of expressing of <strong>abstract meaning</strong>. </p>
<p>When industry era was coming, more new products were made from factory, and there were more knowledges and objects had became difficult be understood by public. People were impact by high-speed cars, they were confused because the noise of machine, they were exciting because the new weapon which showed strong force of army. That’s why futurism became popular. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce53a0dddea053742.jpg" alt="Futurism.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce53a0c808e123516.jpg" alt="Futurism"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/05/22/5ce53a0b319d753730.jpg" alt="Futurism"></p>
<p>In these pictures, we can see the form of Futurism could be concluded as <strong>repeatedly</strong>, <strong>geometrical</strong>，<strong>segmental</strong>. Artist use these style to show the abstract things like wind or speed. For paining building, they generally use exaggerated perspective to show the magnificence of building, because the industry supported stronger structure, and efficiency of construction, which amazed public, and artist showed that by their visual elements.</p>
<h2 id="Futurism-and-Fascism"><a href="#Futurism-and-Fascism" class="headerlink" title="Futurism and Fascism"></a>Futurism and Fascism</h2><p>Futurism promoted the <strong>mechanisation</strong> and <strong>modernisation</strong> of popularisation in western countries, especially in Italy. Italian society focused on industry with a high-level because the effect of Futurism. In this context, which like ‘human can control machine’ , ‘speed is force’ , etc, the thought of <strong>Fascism</strong> inspired in Italy. People desire more resource to do industry producing, so some left-wing people want to grab resource from other country by invasion.</p>
<p>Be enthusiastic with material and science, people could lost some own thinking, they follow other, like cult of personality. In a high concentrate society, each person became a part of group, just like the screw in the country machine. People admire <strong>consolidation</strong>, they focused on the force and honour of country even race. For more efficiently call people to concentrate together, Fascist created a kind of aesthetic to serve their concept, which we can call that Fascism aesthetic. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/06/16/5d06051a0df0022363.jpg" alt="img"> </p>
<p>Fascist glad use <strong>repeat</strong>,<strong>united</strong> elements to make people decrease the position of <strong>own</strong> and enhance the group. This format is similar with Futurism, we can see these genres have strong visuals on emotional effect. The repeat format shows the energy of group, it seems support a safe feeling for individuals. In this environment, individual given their <strong>character</strong> up, and become similar with other component in the group. By this way, the specials and differences of individuals became doesn’t ever important. So we can the see the force of stack and concentration though it could be extreme and aggressive or dictatorship,  individuals got a satisfied situation as they combined in a group. </p>
<p>In visuals aspect, when people focus on a group of elements, they generally see the <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>format</strong> of that, the multiply-style of elements always be ignored. But actually each elements would have different character, even it is tiny, but we still should not ignore that.</p>

So I established an application for easily communicate with real-time information translation. In this post, I will record the brief way to set a chat server, and some visuals technics will be displayed, like <strong>Snap.svg</strong>,<strong>Anime.js</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-WebSocket"><a href="#What’s-WebSocket" class="headerlink" title="What’s WebSocket"></a>What’s WebSocket</h2><p><em>这段用中文写 :P</em></p>
<p>我们的互联网通过HTTP协议来传输数据,即服务器收到请求后会发送相应数据给用户浏览器,浏览器渲染页面. 这个过程其实是 <strong>无状态</strong> 的, 可以理解成,妈妈给小孩喂食,小孩要拍妈妈一下,妈妈才会知道他要吃下一口(这个妈妈可能一边喂饭一边看电视). 而WebSocket,是一种比较新的协议,它允许客户端和服务器长时间的连接在一起,达成握手(HandShake)状态后可以一直传输信息. 所以这种状态可以理解成, 小孩张张嘴,妈妈就把饭喂进来了(妈妈一直乖乖地盯着堡堡呢). 这种协议方式,具有很高的效率并且执行起来比较简单(?). 传统HTTP协议中, 一些类双向连接服务都是通过不断的询问,即,妈妈时不时拍下宝宝,问他要不要继续吃. </p>
<p>好,我理解的就这样了,不能指望一个文科生懂这么深对吧.</p>
<h2 id="Coding"><a href="#Coding" class="headerlink" title="Coding"></a>Coding</h2><p><em>This is not completed code, copy would not effect</em></p>
<p>My server was established by <strong>NodeJs &amp; Express</strong>, so I can use NPM install WebSocket framework. <a href="https://socket.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Socket.io</a> is an excellent frame to build webSocket serve.</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install --save express@4.15.2
// intall express frame

$ npm install --save socket.io
// socket.io
</code></pre><hr>
<p>At Server:</p>
<pre><code>let io = require(&#39;socket.io&#39;)(http);

io.on(&#39;connection&#39;, function(socket){
      console.log(&#39;a user connected&#39;);
      // this log will be showed on console of terminal

      io.emit(&#39;somebodyCame&#39;,socket.id)
      // this command will send msg to ALL user, with new user&#39;s id

      socket.on(&#39;sendMsg&#39;,(msg)=&gt;{
              // when user sent msg to server, 
              // server will operate this function

              io.emit(&#39;sendMsgToAll&#39;, msg )
              // server will send variable as msg to ALL user
      })
});
</code></pre><hr>
<p>At Front-End:</p>
<pre><code>let socket = io();
// socket.js must be referenced in HTML

socket.on(&#39;someBodyCame&#39;,(id)=&gt;{
        DOMElement.innerHTML = id
        // new user&#39;s ID will be displayed on HTML
        // as response of server
})

let msg = &#39;Hello,suzie&#39;
DOMButtonElement.onclick =()=&gt;{
        socket.emit(&#39;sendMsg&#39;,msg) 
        // when the button was clicked
        // &#39;Hello,suzie&#39; will be sent to server
}

socket.on(&#39;sendMsgToAll&#39;,(msg)=&gt;{
        DOMElement2.innerHTML = msg
        // msg will be displayed on HTML
        // ALL of user, in same time
})

<p><strong>User =msg=&gt; Server =msg=&gt; AllUsers</strong></p>

<p>画一个圆很简单,一百个也很简单,一百个有着不同大小颜色的也很简单;不过,怎么从中心分散地随机排列呢?怎么让他们从中心向外移动呢? 我们需要做一点初中水平的数学计算.</p>
<ol>
<li>获得屏幕宽度,高度,得出屏幕中心点坐标</li>
<li>中心坐标加随机正负中点值</li>
<li>获得所有圆心的坐标</li>
<li>计算圆心处于哪个象限,即x,y分别往那个方向移动</li>
<li>计算斜率,得出移动距离</li>
</ol>
<p>其中要点是,得到每个圆的坐标,这需要遍历所有圆:</p>
<pre><code>svg.selectAll(&#39;.cir&#39;).forEach((cir)=&gt;{
        let cirCoor = {
        x:cir.node.getBoundingClientBox().x,
        y:cir.node.getBoundingClientBox().y
        }            
    ...
})
</code></pre><p>要使用Element.getBoundingClientBox()来获取DOM元素在屏幕中的相对坐标,而不是它的属性.它的属性在进行了移动以后数据不会更新,会有偏差.</p>
<p>动画方面使用Anime.js,它使用CSS属性来进行移动元素,非常适合svg动画,性能也很高:)</p>
<pre><code>let ani = anime({
        targets:&#39;.cir&#39;, //使用CSS选择器
        translateX:{
                value: function(el,index,length){
                // 值得注意的是, 使用方法来计算移动值, 方法可以返回 这个对象,对象序列,对象总数
                // 这些数值可以让我们使对象的运动存在差异和相关性
                        return `+=${calcMethod(el)}`
                        // 这里返回的计算是 += , 即在原来的值上增加
                        // 通过这种更新值的方式,可以让元素多次运动
                        // calcMethod()则是需要我们定义的外部计算方法.
                },
                duration:1000,

                        return 10 * index
                        // 序列越高出发时间越久,所以每个元素都是逐个开始运动的
