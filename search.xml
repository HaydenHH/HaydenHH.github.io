    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Blogging!This blog began from Oct 2018, which is the time I started my MA course. At early stage, I used blog to record some experiment and notes on seminar. It is a good way to save and share ideas though nobody ever came here😢😢, it is still a good place I can record my academic life. furthermore, I develop my Blog by Hexo framework, so I learn much knowledge about Web development. And I’m developing more function and style by myself, which real good for my coding ability and career. Let’s talk about more about my Blog construction, function, and future expectation. CategoriesCategory is important to sort post. I used different Caties(categories) to define different function of articles / posts. different caties have individual style and layout, and they have differnt content on index, which support clear information to audience or myself. JournalThis is the essential of blog, most post were defined as Journal, which carry general content, such as note, ideas, experiment, anything else. It could not be academic, and sometime will be post images. So, the layout on index can be divided as two style, preview content&amp; image and abstract. galleryThis is a important class for a visual artist. It shows preview image on index for direct visual expression. Furthermore, the image can be clicked as new block, user can click button to change and scan image of a post. It basically is used to post my outcome or visual experiment. As the increasement of image, I found I might need more style to show differnt kinds of image, such as drawing, photography, vector graphic, motion graphic, video. They are definitely differnt, when I exhibit them, should I use differnt size / resolution ? Maybe. So I add some options in module programme, when code checked differnt type, it generate relateive layout. researchAs digital artist, I would like do research on computer, as well as experiment, so most recording and research article are saved on computer. Then I create this cat as my sketchbook, all of file or text / image can saved and post on research cat, so peers and tutor can easily relize what Im doing. Because it could be simple or short, sometimes massive text from copy and reference, so I decided to use Tag to abstract content of post as research cat. Which means, index only show tag of this kind of post, I and others can click tag to gain more relatvie information from same tag of post. It is a good way to expand idea horizontally. reflectionReflection will be academic when I post that. In future, I will add Grammaly or Translate API to help different language user to understand my article. On index, reflection block will show preview content and catelog and content guide, which means, audience can click a interesting Part / heading of content, and he will go to the sepcific postion of this post. By this way, audience could quickly understand what I’ve done, what steps I used, thinking process. Other expectationI’m going to develop a new cat which can collect ideas. Sometimes I used journal to record idea, but idea could be really short and shuffle, it can not be a article, and it will be burden(累赘) for index, if too many short post are displayed on index. That’s the reason I want to build a idea Page, in this page, all of idea will be grouped and showed, with relative tag, is it sounds really cool? I can shuffle these ideas and randomly scan them when I want to find inspiration. Maybe I can add some function to allow user select some words, and programme will use google search, and find some interdisciplinary research.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F02%2F20%2Fconfirm-a-style-in-animated-illustration%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reflection: the feasibility of interactive illustrationWhat we didLast week, I and my collaborator completed the script of this project. As the first target we confirmed, we will do a project with narrative expression. Which means, we want to talk about a story. The context of story had been confirmed, Technology and love, as well as the content of story, the effect of technology to people and thier love, story can be separate as 3 chapters: they met they are in love they argued future We r going to show different communicate method in different period which be effected by techonology. In deeper meanning, we want to show the different communication methods. Communication can be seen as physical and psychological. When human develop their technology, and communicatino method, they could trend to communicate with physicals. For example, people seek speed and accuracy in communication, but forget the abstract / emotion expression. In this project, the abstraction expression could not be showed. We show shortage of physical communciation, we show affect of rubbish infomation. evaluateDo we successful in this stage? How good we did? To be honest, it is not complete good. Something good: I and my collaborate confirmed a good topic, which suit our common habbit and specialist field we complete a edited / coherence storyboard Our story have a steady point to express something bad: We have not confirmed the final format or work! We have not confirmed style of artistic 20 days left only 😅 Why?At early stage we want to combine Web and animation with a interactive way. Which means, audience can control / effect some elements when it motion. The question is, level / degree of control, how much user can move this elemnts, does it will be paused when user control it?, can user change the frame?, it is animation or PPT-style Web?. We are be limited by technic, therefore, this work could be become techinic-trend, that’s means the narractive / expression would be effected / limited by exist techinic, that’s not cool. HowTo solove this problem, we should understand what we want to say, and which way could be the suitest one. So, I list the specialist of different technic: format / attribute coherence flexibility interactivity reusability difficulty stylistic animation-autoPlay very good, even with rhythm can add color Filter No can be added on 3D model rhythm control vector rely, weak pixel motion PPT-like animation weak, stop animation high randomness speed of read image reusable low complexed allowed game-like animation very weak even can’t play ex, choose-base visuals ex, user effect narrative low programme-base vector mainly After I listed these advantages and disadvantages of different format, I thought, I can choose different method to express different range / chapter of story. Before I combine / choose a format, it is good to experiment at first, so next step I could make some samples, and we will discuss more about the effect of communication, and can different methods represent different technologies? ReflectionIn this progress, I knew the importance of a steady target of expression, which means, when we doing a project and we have many different option of idea / methodologies, we should choose one with our requirement or expression, the method can express the idea. So, in future work, before option choosing, I will conclude the difference of methods, and their advantages / disadvantages. If I have enough time, try it, then give answer, else list them, analyze them.]]></content>

And I want to use Two story at first, then they will concentrate. It will show the influence of war. When we discuss this idea, my collaborator said, the reason of war is hard to be expressed by communication. In my view, conflict and war could be caused by false communication, so the communication in love and war would have common point. But, the reason of war could be influenced by many aspects, not only communication. Furthermore, in this project, we have not too much time, so we should limit the quantity of work.

It’s helpful to set a button, because sometimes user will select the text on the button, and it will affect experience. JavascriptCircle index in ArrayWhen design a photo album, developer usually collect all src (link) of image in a Array, and control index to choose a link then exhibit on HTML. When user click button, the index will increase or decrease, and the img tag will update src. But the array has a fixed length, if index bigger / less than length / 0, it will be a problem. So I found this code: while (index &lt; 0) index += srcArr.length while (index &gt; srcArr.length) index -= srcArr.length It means, if the index become negative, it will become the last element in array, as well as other situation (first). So index will circle change.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[familyFunction of a familyFrom: 7 Important Functions of Family Ogburn and Nimkoff: (i) Affectional (ii) Economic functions (iii) Recreational(娱乐的) functions (iv) Protective functions (v) Religious functions and (vi) Educational functions K. Davis : (i) Reproduction (ii) Maintenance (iii) Placement and (iv) Socialization of the young Same-sex family Same-sex couple families accounted for one per cent of all couple families: 87,000 same-sex couple families were cohabiting, 47,000 were in a civil partnership, and 29,000 were married. 14,000 same-sex couple families had dependent children. These children may have come from a previous relationship or through other opportunities such as adoption, artificial insemination, or surrogacy. In the year to 31 March 2016, same-sex couples in the U.K. adopted 450 children, or 9.6 per cent of the total number of children adopted in that year. Most researchers in the field agree that children raised by one or two gay or lesbian parents suffer no particular disadvantage. Same-sex family are becoming more common, and the homosexual have became more acceptable in more countries, somewhere even allow homosexual marriage. Will it change the tranditional family construction? In the end, the cereal packet family contained the seed of its own destruction. Today more than ever, people are chasing romance and, in the process, creating instability. High divorce rates over the years have led to a considerable number of lone parents and reconstituted families. Assisted by rising life expectancies, economic and social forces are shifting responsibility back onto the extended family, and, at the same time helping to ease an epidemic of loneliness among the elderly. Younger people are choosing cohabitation over marriage, and it is possible to envisage a looser form of cohabitation overtaking marriage, along with a more serial or task-driven approach to partnering over the course of a lengthening lifespan. The relation between man and woman is increasingly one of equals, although it is very apparent from lone parent families in particular that women are still doing the bulk of the childrearing. More and more people are choosing a childfree life, or having children outside of a more traditional arrangement, and both these trends seem set to continue. It is still early days for same-sex relationships, which may grow more common as gender and sexuality become more fluid and relationships less beholden to old stereotypes and an imperative for procreation. Contemporary marriage could have became more flexible and free, people might want have more private time or space, somebody even give up marriage, they chose live together but not in law. Family and populationFrom: What will the family of the future look like? Childbearing is higher in countries with higher levels of female labour force participation, economic development, generosity of paid parental leave provision for mothers and paternity leave. However, look at the chart above and you can see that in all countries women still devote more time than men in housework activities. The gender revolution is far from being fully completed, even in the gender-egalitarian Nordic countries.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F02%2F14%2FTech-and-communication%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Technology and communicationDuring the collaboration, we thought about how technology changed human’s method of communication. Different to other creature, human-being have strong relationship in group and society, because of the effective communication. What improve the communication? Painting / image Language / character Paper / Printing Telegraph / telephone Radio / TV / Fax Mobile phone Internet / WIFI AR / VR There’s the history of development of communication, people used more advanced tech to improve the efficiency of communication, speed, distance, accuracy. the form of communicationCommunication can be defined as physical and psychological, object or subject. Whatever any technologies we used on communication, that would be express our content. To narrative or record someting in the past, could be hard. People used painting to describe a action, method, story, object; they invented language to talk with each other; they wrote by characters, but original technology limited these methods, bad container, bearer, low efficiency, so people were inventing new technology to communnicate. content of communicationMethods are changing, ever. But the content people communicated would not be changed, in sometimes. People talk, discuss, express. All of people have family, everyone will fall in love, they expressed thier love, emotion. Family and loveFamily, love could be the eternal topic in human society, because creature need multiply, people generate children, and hold a group, as a family. WarWar is horrible, but unfortunately, we are hard to doubt that, war can be remove. Indeed, human have joined war million years, never stopped. Even the technology is developed to serve the war. So, in content of communication, war is the topic can’t be remove. relationship between Love &amp; WarIt looks ironical, love and war can be seen as two contrast symbols, love represent life, and war is death. Life and death, is the eternal circle in world. So they are opposite things. Would war ever exist in future?This question is impossible to answer now, but I will do more research at this point. Now, I can only guess, that war would not disappear. Maybe we will stop war on the Earth, but war will not stop in universe. (hahah, this is not a fiction novel). Why? In my view, multiply is a thing which affect others and profit self. Generation will use resource, and the gerneration is infinite, resource is limited, there is necessary conflict on division of resource. So conflict will not disappear, as well as war. About collaborative projectAs we planned, the outcome would be a Web aniamted illustration. The main topic will relate Tech &amp; communication, and the content of communication, would be relate love and war, or only love, it depend on time we have. StyleIn early expectation, this work should show our ability at image making and editing. Therefore each piece of picture would be coherence and narrative. constract on editingWe might use image about love and war like interlock,so each frame could make strong constrast on mind, and we might use constract on colours, like Complementary colour or colour tone &amp; grey tone even Black &amp; White . parallism editingI mentioned that, the content of communciation would not change,( love and war) so we might use same content in differnet space or time, with different technology or method of communication. Cool.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Way of seeingIn western clutre, female could be seen in main stream art. At first, people be seen as their own concpet. Then, some women in painting, could be seen as stranger of some one familiar with. The sight of viewer changed. A women’s spectator could be a real man, especially male, but the spectator of a men, could be world or environment. To paint a man, his power or concious could be the main point, but as a women, that could be pysical beauty even sexual in some classcical painting. nudityNudity sometime was disguise, exaggerated to show the body. And in European classcial painting, some wemon could take a mirror and seeing their self. Even right now, women will be focus by anything can be seen as mirror, because they can see their self. women be seen as object objected Ad.In classical painting, women’s case were drew as a exaggratted action to show thier beauty.In current market, women were used to put on cover / poster / Ad, to attract men. female gazeSome film use some ‘sexual’ shot to grab focus, such as take a shot of skinny body, naked leg.

    <title><![CDATA[Play with computer]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F02%2F02%2FPlay-with-computer%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Play with computerIs computer fool? No, you saw Alpha Go, you saw the super calculator. But I say, computer is still a tool fool right now. It rely on your order / operation, sometimes even doesn’t work though. Well, let’s talk about some function it took me and the reason I thought it is a fool, then I will show some methods to deal with computer. Painting with computerAs a designer, computer supported sorts of methods to draw, whatever vector graphic, bitmap,or motional graphic. For painting, CG ^1 can imitate real textrue or materials even stroke / brush and press. Basically, CG can be defined Shaded &amp; Flat (厚涂,平涂)for me. Shaded painting means artist will shade the graphic to make it looks more like real, object’s volume / 3D can be described as a objective effect. Flat painting have become more popluar than 10 years ago, this style gernerally use solid color and flat shape. Sometimes it’s abstract but has stronger visuals. Furthermore, in Japanese animation field, flat colours are filled into outline of comic, and make animation. Because frame should be drew individually, so flat color is the best way to fill. Animation and CurveHow to make a animation? By hand, draw every frames, which is easily understand. But different frames count in 1 second will take different effect. 6-7 frames/s obviously lag, for: stop motion 12 frames/s bascially smooth, for: general animation 24 frames/s really smooth, for: action expression / film 60 frames/s extremelly smooth, for: game It’s sooo hard to draw all frames by hand right?Well, we have computer now, so how can it help artist to make aniamation then. Key frames animationSet 2 frames, and computer will generate other frames. It looks wonderful, but, not at all. Key frames only generate simple transform: translate rotate skew scale For example, if I set two point, one is 0, another is 100. Then computer will generate graphic begin 0 to 100, but the graphic will not change except I set other animation. In AE, we can also use cursor to build motion, moving cursor of a graphic will make it as if it be pull / drag, because this action will keep the original shape, so it looks like a organic motion. AE expression 表达式Imagine that, you want to let 5 ball move to right from left, one by one. The first thing you might inspire could be set different location of cursor on timeline, so they begin from different time. It’s OK, but, how about 100 balls, you can’t do that right, so we use expression. AE expression is base on Javascript, we can use expression to get different values and set frames. transform.position + time * 100 * index transform.postion means this component ‘s current position time is the progress on timeline index is the index of layer This expression means this component will countinue move with time, and it will increase the distance with a higher layer. Bezier curveComputer is good at render geometric, but it can draw curve like human. So we should use Bezier curve to order computer to render a curve. Bacially, Bezier curve can render by SVG and P5.js or other language. And it can be sorted as: Linear Bezier Quadratic Bezier Cubic Bezier Different Bezier should be applied different handle point to control the curve. Quadratic need 2 points, cubic 3. To move the handle point, we can control the motion of curve. p5.js: shapeBegin() vertix(x,y); vertix(handleX,handleY); vertix(handleX2,handleY2); vertix(endX,endY); endShape() We can add more describe by add vertix() expression, it apply the coordition of a point to draw line. It is a good way to set point base on mouseX, mouseY, so computer will follow the user’s operation. If the motion should be set as automatically action, we can use frameCount , which will continue increase with timeline. Because the framecount will infinitve increase, so use cos(frameCount) to get a range of value from 0 to 1. If the handle point should move as a circle, we should get the function of circle, which return X and Y on a circle. let cX = x + r * cos(angle * PI / 180) let cY = y + r * sin(angle * PI /180) This is a function to get every point, when we set angle as framecount, this function will continue output coordinate of a circle, and we can use that to set value of handle of Bezier, it can move innifitve.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Think about population]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F01%2F28%2FThink-with-population%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Think about populationDuring before visual experiments, I began to think about the growth of population in our planet. As we know, we had have 6 billion population, and this count will increase dramatically in future, as well as the problem from that. What’s the problemDoes population make problem or improve industry? It depends. If this region have the ability to support suitable education / medical / insurgent, and the most important, the FOOD. Which probably means a rich region’s can generate more population with higher level than poor region. It’s crude, but it is truth. So it would be the problem. problem in poor regionIf compare the income or Disposable income^1 with other region, the lowest level’s region could be seen as ‘poor region’. Pool region can’t support balanced / complete education for people, so they would want have more children , it is not a directly evidence or reason, but basically, the people who have high education would not be going to have 1 more children even 1 child. [^2] We can see this chart, in Japan, the birth rate was decline with the increase of female education rate it could evidence the effect of education rate on birth rate. Furthermore, in my country, pool region generally have a higher birth rate than other region, because in some countrysides, people need more population to join agricultural producing. So it made a tradition. Low education &amp; High birth rate, these factors might influence the security / environment. In addition, some serious pool region can’t control the birth growth, might be the people have not enough contraception^3 concept / method, or some religion opinion influence them. So they could face food shortage. “The problem is that less than 10 per cent of women in these countries are using modern contraception, a strong political commitment to a community-based approach to contraception can sharply slow population growth” Bremner To conclusion, pool region can’t hold a stable education, somewhere even can’t give enough food, but the birth rate was continually / uncontrollably increase. Problem in rich regionA rich region basically has a high productivity, but it even has a lower birth rate than poor region, even it has higher medical / education condition. But these positive point could be the reason lead low birth rate, people don’t want to have children. This reason can be easily understood, cause children are tiny evils. This phenomenon will lead a result, with the high productivity and low birth rate, the productivity and production will be excess, so rich countries will export their productivity to poor region. It might bring these effect: Advantages FOOD problem could be solved because of the help from rich countries. The market can continue growth. More work opportunities Global progress improved the communication of culture. disadvantages Local industry will collapse / distinct, even lose sovereignty^4 Extreme export, such as Fascism Capital bubble from Credit Negative national competition summaryTo analyse the phenomenon of population’s change, and base on current sciential / political context, I can suppose some theorems ^5 : Population will increase infinitively Commercial / Education vs. Growth rate is in inverse proportion^6 Productivity export to Poor region Poor population immigrate to Rich region VisualisationIt could be interesting to imitate the process of population growing by visuals graphic. I’m going to design a programme to imitate that with a specific algorithm which base on these theorems I supposed before. It might show the process of human communication and cultural mix. Here are some images I made, which use simple logic, but they can show the collection of groups, which have different colours and size, they are becoming bigger from edge to center. for(let i=1;i&lt;row;i++){ // drawing element on row for (let v = 1; v &lt; row; v++) { // drawing element on vertical s1.paper.circle(x,y,size) } } The basic logic is using twice For circulation,to draw a matrix of points. More detailsDuring before experiment, I can guess the visuals form in this project. But the most attractive things are those supposition, I can make a range of motional graphics or animation or series of pictures to show the progress of population increase, base on random event but defined rate, can it imitate a kind of process of human multiply? What regular I can find, which I even haven’t set. 基于随机的事件和固定的概率，图形的发展和变化能体现出什么样的规律，它是否可以展示人类繁衍的潜在行为？ +++]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Short-time workIn this workshop, we been asked to choose some materials to briefly make a work. It could be improve our ability of grouping and idea expression. Which means, in a short-time progress, the technic might not be developed, the important thing is using exist elements to create a simple work but it can express some ideas. Materials chooseAt first, I tried to find some new materials which can painting with interesting style. Then I found cotton, which female use to make-up. (//^-^//). It has really good quality at save water, so watercolour can have a fluency separating, as well as Chinese ink and colour pencil. Got ideaAfter finish some painting, I saw there are look like the Earth, in addition, the separating of colours, let me associated with the growth of population in our planet. And the mixed colours could be seen as the mixed culture when civilisation exclude. I like to read science fiction, and I inspired by Galactic Empire / The three body problem / 2001 Space odyssey, I thought human being will exclude infinitively, as well as population. But we can see, there are many problem on population in global wide, such as growth uncontrollably / unbalanced, or negative growth. So I’m going to explore these problem, and the reason / factor which affect these phenomenon. Programme as outcomeI used Javascript to create repeat circle, and Anime.js to set the transform.]]></content>

As an other kind of exhibition, gallery is the place to show artist’s work. Studio can change / effect the style of idea, it could improve the idea from artist, because of the group in studio, idea can be discuss and group by a quickly way. Process and outcomeIs the process important than final outcome? Different ideology / methodology in working process will reflect the variation. Outcome can be seen as the proof of thinking track, develop, so an outcome could be the conclusion of hold project, so it is still important for reflection.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Trip to tateIn this Friday, we went to the Tate modern museum to catch inspiration. Actually, I visited here twice, but this time is still gave me new ideas even something I didn’t understand. atmosphere of buildingAs a famous contemporary museum, Tate modern has a good design at interior design and architecture. We can see a clear structure in this building, and wall paint, sometimes the wall is original so it shows a concrete material or iron. In my view, it can decrease the attraction of building so viewer can focus more on exhibitions. A big painting on ground I don’t know who is the man painted on ground XD, and I even don’t know it is a painting before I backed to upper floor. It is really big so people stand beside the painting are hard to fully view it. To more specific observe, it is paint as different points with different distance and size, it could be generated by Python or other programme. In the picture I took, there is a child is standing in the work, she might not know she has been surrounded by this art work, but this work indeed effected her. Is it the effect of art? It could be invisible or potential, but it does work. As well as atmosphere/ environment, it will not illustrate a specific meaning, but it effect on content and feeling. Light and DarkThe Light &amp; Dark always can be the good tool for artists. It create strong visual to catch focus. The motional text with bright light can easily get attention, and the artist used angle and bulb to create a triangle light. And in this work, light generated sort of shadow which have different clarity, so it exhibit the change of hierarchy because of the distance between objects and light source. Magic of materialsContemporary artist generally will not be limited by materials, they can show concept through any thing if it is possible. I saw the upper one as a piece of soil which be lifted, so it could be understood as the remove of soil, and the conflict between nature and human. Materials can take directly feeling which can guide viewer to associate with relative expression. Furthermore, it can combine with graphic language to improve visual effect. history of artAfter trip in Tate, I joint a lecture which speak by Ben. He briefly talked about history of art. As a designer, I must admit I have not enough interests in fine arts and classical art. But I do like expressionism or abstractionism. the progress of artDoes idea being more important in art? Review the history of art, ideas and concepts look take more parts in an art work, some artist even gave traditional methods up to show their idea. As a part of culture, art can be seen as the tool which convey ideology and attitude, so public require art become more expressive, especially during a war. Does art influence a WarThe art work after war could be more popular for a collector, cause we can clear see the influence of war to the artist or society. But, can we find some work which effect a war? We see, some style such as Dada / Pop art, are influenced by war, they could be the result of war. Futurism was popular in early 20th Centry Italy, it focus on expression of speed/ motion/ machine/ industry, in my view, it promote the increase of materialism in Italy.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[collaboration with a Film makerTo complete the project which require collaboration with other, I found a student who learning in MA Film. She has professional cognition in shot design, so I can get advanced suggestion on animation making or screen writing. The early topic we chose is about relationship in contemporary partner. Because of the culture shock, emotion between different people could be hard to understand by other who from different countries. Therefore we are going to focus more on behaviour side, which means, in the animation, the emotion expression could not be rendered as main point, the phenomenon and behaviour will be more important in this project. Reason I explore relationship between partnerThere are many developed countries are holding a low population growth, evermore negative growth. In my opinion, this phenomenon is because of the change of marry. Children and children education is becoming kind of bear in a family especially in high-knowledge level group. More and more partner have strong individual concept, and they are becoming more independent.So I want to explore the reason people become more independent with partner, it could be include the physical factors or emotional reason.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[reproductionToday’s manufacture will copy or reproduce art work in a bad quality or massive quantity. It improve the influence of some great art works, but there are some negative influences in time: overexposure decrease potential value because of the massive copies change the attitude of visitor For more example of reproduction, many of art works have been displayed on Web, App, sorts of media and screen. required commercial valueMuseum or gallery announce them through reproduce classical works, it indeed in work, attract more viewer / gain more profit in sub-production. So they can have more opportunitiesto protect arts. infinite reproduce, infinite misunderstandingAs a significant count of reproduction have been made in market, audiences have a high cognition to some classical art work. In the time, they will have different attitude to these sub-production as well as paintings. In today’s workshop, my peers created some experiments to express the process of misunderstanding and distortion. repeat photocopyPhotocopy a painting with 10 times, what does it look like? Digitally, pixel will increase, so it will lose details and sharpness. Furthermore, the colours will change to be more bright which have higher saturation. Fine lines will become bolder and look as if they’ve been engrave , because of lines look like rise up, and generate bigger contrast with background, so it has an engrave-alike texture. de-adjectivePeople generally describe and understand object through read adjective. A peer removed most adjectives in a text which describe the girl with pearl earring. Then she found it look as if it is describing Mona Lisa. It shows the influence of second-hand cognition, people will easily change the attitude because of different descriptions. So I thought we can see something in different angle, a general sight and illustratively.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Reflection:Finished at Programming stage]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F01%2F02%2FReflection-Finished-at-Programming-stage%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reflection: About programming and concept of building WebBasically, I’ve finished this Web during this term. To summary, this Web is designed to devote translate words to graphic information. The content I used is Chinese classical poem, I catched poem by JSON which be supported by Gushi.ci. Therefore, user can get massive poem randomly, and they can try to understand it by graphic as well as the translation supported by Baidu’s API. Now, I’m going to conclude some problem I faced, and the final solution. use Javascript module to create elements in time.The target is showing a gallery on Web, there are many of image had been upload on cloud server, and display by href Link. I collected all of link in JSON file, and the Web can read link than create elements. module style and EventAs ECMA6 declared: $(&#39;body&#39;).append(` &lt;p&gt;Content:${Variable}&lt;/p&gt; `) ` (反引号) this symbol can include string and variable, which means it is easy to create module and generate elements on HTML.The question is I should add event listener to elements for motion and interaction. After every new generations, I added event listener repeatedly, which means when user interact with that element, it will response many times! The original method is: Array.from(.elements).forEach((t)=&gt;{ t.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;,function(){ ... }) }) To add EL for every elements, I chose a class, and set to an Array, so it can use forEach() to iterate (遍历). But, the existed elements will be added EL again, which is horrible..So I changed the method of add, I chose the last element which is the last generated, and add EL for it. The important thing is Selector. The SVG object can be chosen by CSS selector or DOM selector, so I would like to set attribute of SVG by Anime.js let cir = svg.paper.circle(x,y,r) //create circle element cir.attr({ class:&#39;.cir-in-svg&#39; }) // set class so it can be chosen by CSS/Anime anime({ targets:&#39;.cir-in-svg&#39;, translateX:[ {values:100,duration:1000,easing:&#39;linear&#39;}, {values:0,duration:1000,easing:&#39;linear&#39;} ], opacity:1, duration:function(el,i,l){ return 500 + i*100 // el=targets,i=index,l=length } }) SVG can be set by CSS with a good performance and interactivity. So in future work, my main direction will be vector graphic and interactive animation. add a random item from existed ArrayThis is a really usually requirement in WEB application, users could load more elements in time, but if every times they click and see same arrangement, there will not be cool. There is a simple solution: create a new array, **random** select an element and push to new Array, then return the new one, I thought. That’s wrong. Because it will add repeat elements, if randomly choose. So, the new solution is use Set type which declared by ECMA6, it like Array, can be iterated by for(..of..) The most important thing is : Set can not save same element const originArr = [a,b,c,d,e] let ranSet = new Set() do { ranSet.add(originArr[Math.floor(Math.random() * originArr.length)]) } while (ranSet.size&lt;5); let newArr = Array.from(ranSet) So, the newArray is the new Array which is absolutely random.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F11%2F07%2FPattern-export%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Pattern exportAfter finished the logical stage, I can get accurate data of Chinese Character, so I can generate graphic by these data. The after question is that, how can I form these words. Methodology of generation Translate each words to shape. Translate whole sentence, random choose some elements to build graphic. collect data and choose some of them to build whole typing words. Attribute of graphicTo build a group of graphic, each attribute of that should be defined by data which collected from user typing. I did a mindmap to clarify that: GraphicAbstractabstract shape like geometry graphic can represent some feeling or emotion that hard to describe, and it can be generate quickly, efficiently and easily. Objectspecific shape can be used to represent the radicals of character, because it can show real objects they are. So this attr might be supplied by Radical. FillThis attribute decide how this shape be filled and drawn. colortextrueTexture might be generated by bitmap or Noise patternHere I drew some pattern by AI, but in later project, it could be generated directly by Javascript, which support interaction with user. Formpositionsymmetry transformcomposeThis is a error, but it has strong visuals because of repetition and growth Content of projectThe original idea is showing visualisation of CC, by actually I can’t convey absolutely right information of word. Therefore, I might need an other form to express this project. A story? or A location which user can generate. For summary, user should get more aspiration to type rather than type something random. Here is a illustration I did..I’m improving this method of drawing.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F11%2F01%2FReflection-Developing-CC-visualisaiton-T-3%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reflection: CCV type-3WEB LINK After 5 days, I basically understood the using of p5.js 😃, so I continually refine the idea about visualisation of CC (Chinese Character). To definitely show the differences of characters, I chose Strokes counts to generate points and lines. In this article I will describe most progress and details. Point &amp; LineAs my early experiments, the words were analysed and render as SVG shape, and these shapes are similar with real symbol of tone. It can clearly show the tone of words, but my expectation is not only show Tone of word. Individual elements should connect each other, as same as the composition of sentence is words. To express the composition of sentence, I decided to use Lines as the format of compose. Which means every words will be translated to individual elements, and they connect and group as lines. Now, I would like to remember the process of create lines. Thinking process/ methodologyTwo points can be connected as a line. (两点一线)It is really clear, a creation of line in computer, should have two points, and each point should be marked as X &amp; Y. Therefore, I should provide X1,X2,Y1,Y2 to draw a line in programmer. line(x1,y1,x2,y2) So, I tried to make groups of points, which base on Stroke of count. CCV type-2Here is the first outcome of Points, the quantity of points equal the strokes count of word. To be honest, it is really simple, even ugly. However, the only reason I did that is, I try to successfully create right counts of point. CCV type-2+Next step, I connected every points, by lines. There are many developments on logical stage, I will list that but it is so complex to clarify every things(太懒了，解释不清): Wrap 换行 Javascript Object Loop render 实时渲染 Actually, it is more ugly than I did before. Firstly, black is too thick when it shows on dense lines. Secondly, the order of points is too regular, so these lines create many sharp negative room, which make too strong contrast. So bad. 辣眼睛啊. CCV type-3. Curve! Bezier curve!To save my ** thick work, I decided to use curve, beautiful curve. Different with hand-draw curve, computer actually not good at draw curve. Thank for great mathematicians,(对不起，王老师，杨老师，熊老师我没学好数学) we indeed have method to let computer render curve. One of that, is Bezier curve**. It means, we can set handles to control the curve of line.Bezier Curve edit tool bezierCurve(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4) //x2,y2;x3,y3; mean the points of handle. DecorationAs MA IVM student, it is impossible to work without decoration. Actually, not only decoration, but also for better interaction and communication of user. In this step, I begin to consider the outlook of webpage, such as colour, layout, interaction and performance. colourI changed the colour of background to show more strong curves. download original image on Dropbox layoutCurrently, there are some questions need to develop: Input might be available to move with viewpoint, so user can preview the image when they are typing. Button extremely need to improve! Difficult to understand, ugly style. 天啊. Poem bank should be easier to use, and I might be should add more one box to show the content, so user can save more time.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F28%2FPoor-images-and-Glitch-art%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What’s poor imagePoor image generally are low quality digital image, which means it is defined base on sharpness and resolution. In Defense of the Poor Image Poor image could be more Rich Poor image contain experimental and artistic materials but also incredible amounts of porn and paranoia. They are popular that can be made and seen by the many They are easier communicated and stored. There are more people can read poor image because its cheap cost. In addition, everyone can edit image, so people will reedit image to be suitable for themselves. Poor image give more possibilities whatever good or bad多样性！variousDigital images are saved by different format and attribute generally but they will lose resolution when they are translated to different format. Furthermore, with editing of users or read, original images might be changed with different style such as colours or tone. After hundreds circulation, it could change to a completely different situation. 盗版不想说太多。反正就是盗版资料可能改变了影响了原作对社会的影响。 in the age of file-sharing, marginalised content circulates again and reconnect dispersed worldwide audiences. poor images are shared in Internet, increase the speed of dispersion and communication. Because of it can be free, it expand the viewing realityThe poor image could not be same as original, it changed situation, information of image: swarm, circulation, digital dispersion(分散，散布), fractured(破裂) and flexible. After personal editing, original works are realised and destructed by individual methods, so poor images are not original. Idea!The contrast between original image and poor image could be represented by vector image and bitmaps graphic. It might have strong visual. Poor images are deconstructed by many person as their opinion. So there are infinitive possibilities to change/ edit, understand an original work. In my project, the original information user supported will be translated as their customs. Glitch artSometimes, compression artefact could create some special effect s which have strong style. There are different type of format in compression artefact: Aliasing 混叠 Blur, which include motion blur, defocus blur. Defocus blur include 镜外失焦，湍流 turbulence, 短曝光失焦 Block boundary artefacts Noice 噪点 Glitch art generally are generated by high saturation colours and geometric shape. It could be imitated by simple programmer.I did a test web by P5.js as the experiment of my project. User can draw block with the motion of mouse.Drawing!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Get stroke countsAfter last tutorial, Ive continually developed the Web project. I added new function to get the strokes of words which user typed. Then I would like to reflect the hold process, what difficulties I faced, the idea I got, and the methodology of reach. Retrieve databaseThe principle of analyse data actually just search database, which means every element I might use, have existed in database, it could be prepared or made in time. It is easy to get data, such as stroke counts of word, but the difficult thing is to translate that to a new data, which can be used to generated shape. Data-driven shapeData-driven graphic design 32p: “Unlike the physical process of making a mark with a pen, brush, or even a digital tablet, computational drawings are created by a written list of programming instructions based on rules and procedures that a programmer writes, a computer translates and executes the instructions into individual marks lines, and shapes on the screen.” Computer generate different graphic base on the data have supported. In current stage, I want to use ‘Stroke’ to effect the format of graphic, which means how shapes group up and how they connect each other. The reason I thought is, Chinese word s sometimes have big differences in structure and strokes, it will effect visuals. The strokes will influence the complexity of the outlook, though it is irrelative to meaning generally, it can clear show different characteristics of words Make points as coordinateI create a series of points by strokes count of each word, so every word will have some points which can be the coordinate. In future work, some specific shape could be set in the coordinate. Furthermore, basing on different Tone, the layout of point could be changed, because Strokes merely influence the quantity of points. render graphic base on different coordinate of each wordsThe question is, I haven’t decided which way I render graphic. There are two method to render graphic I can use now, SVG, render by Snap.js Bitmap, render by P5.js SVG available me to create more beautiful/ delicate shape with high-quality resolution. And Bitmap graphic can generate more curve and massive geometric shape. In future work I will do that both and choose one or both as final effect. The difficulties I faced nowdata analyse在早期进程中，变量的提取非常困难，尤其是我需要逐个把用户键入的字符匹配数据库，当匹配数据库后，再分析它的别的属性。逻辑层面必须非常清晰：用户键入————每一个字————属性，如笔画读音偏旁拼音，检索音调；笔画————生成坐标，坐标————通过笔画数判断坐标数量，通过别的属性决定坐标排列方式偏旁，检索特定的含义，其含义必须被单独设定，手动 whole styleThe work must be designed to illustrative, it should give the feeling of words, it doesn’t represent a whole sentence, but it should show the abstract meaning of words.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Reflection:Early visualisation of Chinese]]></title>
    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F25%2FReflection-Early-visualisation-of-Chinese%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reflection: Early experiments about visualisationIn this stage, I’ve done a prototype of visualisation application, it available user to support dynamic data and translate to geometric shape. I used JavaScript to build the application as well as NodeBox and illustrator. Then I will review the process of work. Source of ideaAt first, we visited the V&amp;A museum, there are series of digital arts exhibited. I observed the layout and variant of graphic, but was confused by the irregular shape. I tired to find the reason and the meaning of artists want to convey. I failed. 这些数字渲染的作品充满了不确定性和随机性，但是不变的是他们的排列方式。艺术家用特殊的算法计算了图形的位置，并通过控制变量的方法让图形拥有不同的形状或者结构。 In M.Mohr’s work, I saw his algorithm generate shape as random symbol, they are ordered in grid system with a tiny translation of position. So I want to collect information and data as variable to generate more specific shape. I chose Chinese letter as the source of information, because Chinese letter can be separated to be different parts which have individual meanings. Work processTo complete my idea, it is important to distinguish the letter. I set a database, it will return the value of phonogram, stroke count, radical of letter whatever user type are( except special/strange word or symbol ). After return of data, I used JS to analyse that and change the image which show on Web. 通过的采集的数据的分析，再遍历数据库，当有匹配对象的时候，返回它的详细信息，例如拼音，笔画和部首。 通过拆分返回的拼音字符串，再遍历每个字符串，与音调的数据库匹配，返回后即可以得到那个有音调的拼音所属于的音调。 Base on the tone of letters, specific shape will be set on Web. The method of render image is add and append tag in DOM as &lt;embed src=Dynamic link&gt;svg img&lt;/embed&gt; GoodthingTo see a draft effect, I chose tone as variable to make graphic. I successful complete the logical stage (逻辑层面). Though it just show tone as characteristic of a word, it is easily to add more effect on shape. It clearly shows the differences of Chinese character which same as my first expectation Something need to developMore illustrativeI used shape of symbol to show the tone of word, which is same as we daily use. But the final outcome should not be the showing of symbol. The expression of tone might be a method/ structure when rendering shape. So, they the variable from tones should have the ability that show the change of tone/ level. Curve might be a good choice. In future work, there will more information be add in graphic, but how should I keep a balance? What’s the composition of individual graphic?]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F24%2FDraft-Visualizetion-of-tone-of-Chinese-word%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Draft: Dynamic visualisation of Tone of Chinese letterWEB Link As I said, Chinese is a language use tone to define meaning of word, so a same spell/ pronunciation will have definitely different meaning if they have different tone. I’ve did a draft of Web, it available user to type Chinese and get individual Tone. In future work, user will get more information, such as radicals and stroke count, they will both be series variable to create geometric shape. Tone of wordThere are four tones in Chinese pronunciation system: Level tone (平声) Rising tone Falling-rising tone Falling tone (去声) It is complex compare with western language, different tone decide different meaning of words, so there are some difficulties in communication. Even in local communication, people could be confused when they talk with others who use different accent. There are so many accent in south of China, and they could use different tone in pronunciation system. It is impossible to use geometric shape to represent word, but in this project, I want find commonness(共性） of parts of word, so I want to summarise the character of different tone in pronunciation, and how can I use graphic language to convey the meaning of parts of Chinese word. Characteristic of toneLevel ToneLevel Tone is smooth and stable tone, but sometimes it decide the basic tone of a sentence. So it might be represent begin, it could be changed depends on the emotion of speaker. Therefore, it could be a random colours in the begin of sentence. Rising ToneWith the increasing of tone, the length of pronunciation is rise too. So it is clearly that we could use Rising gradient colours to express that. On the other hand, it could give people the feeling of slow down because of the length of pronunciation is longer than other tone. So I might find some elements to convey the feeling of slow. Falling-Rising ToneIt a change of direction. The first idea is contrast colours to represent this tone. Such as the contrast Hue, lightness of colours. Falling ToneIt should be quick and heavy. When people pronounciate falling tone, they generally emphasise the stress of word, a falling tone could have strong emotion and expression.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Start at P5.jsMost digital artists might realize about Processing, which can make good data driven design. However, it made by Java, so it merely run on 模拟器(simulators) , it is not convenient to suitable different devices today. So, P5 is a good replacement, it base on Javascript so most devices such as mobile desktop both run it. What does P5 do?Same as processing, it drive data to generate graphic. It generate shape in canvas element, so it makes bitmap graphics basically. advanced aspectsaccessibilityIt base on Javascript so most devices support to run P5 scripts. Furthermore, it is super easy to write! It has Event function which can continue monitor and return the position of mouse, so shapes can be dynamic and changed or move with the operation of user. High performanceBitmap graphics are suitable to generated massively, different with SVG in html, bitmap graphics not add DOM, so it can be rendered quickly.]]></content>

Projectpractice based researchDo practice as research, collect experience and knowledge in experiment. Think about WHY, Why you, why now benefit from course institution and fund application as PhD working process, some outcome or inspiration could come from different work/ research, it is a loop, artist should consider before work process, and make reflective development. The elements in research process could be considered as different way, it depends what background/ context it comes from. A artist should connect different elements as narrative group to support information. We see the graphic in image, and analyse the background, story, history of image. What is documentIn my view: Document could be the article which made with description, image or reference. It show something clear, and can be saved individual. It should be sorted. Tomas Keenan and Hito Steyler give some description.To teach, evidentiary proof, They are contested, meanings explored and contrasted. We have experienced a shift from the document as evidence, to the document as trigger and catalyst of events Primary sources P research is original record. Secondary sources Writing and understanding from primary sources. How Analysis description Things I feel are evoked by or associated with the artefact Why chose Strength and shortcomings Analysis This work shows a group of symbols. Although they look irregular, actually they are made by strict algorithms that means computer render them by a specific programmer or ruler. This work can be remade thousands times without once completely same group, but they are made with same visual language . The key point in this work is variable which means the work base on essential elements, and they grouped with random way, because of variable. The reason I appreciate this work is, variable available us to create a work which can be dynamic and random. It can convey multiple emotions and information, because different users might have individual information, so a dynamic work could bring more specific feelings. This work is made by circles and poly line, they order by algorithm and changed with variable. It shows a strong visual, but it has supported more specific information, that means it merely show graphic and regular, rather then represent a emotion or story. It is only shape. Therefore, in my work, I would like to draw more informative graphic which might show more potential feeling.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Thinking about VariablesIn digital creation, variable could be really important. It is generally used to replace a value, which could change between different individuals. Such as colours, size, position, count, ratio, etc… It makes work looks various and interesting (我真不知道丰富的英文怎么写). So, the topic is, why we use variable in design rather then fixed value, and does ‘random’ really interested user? Method of making a dynamic art workThe word ‘dynamic’ here means something could change easily and quickly. For example, Photoshop might be the best friend of us no🙃, the ‘smart object’ could be used in a high frequency. It can show the graphic as one layer, which could be combine with multiply layer. The useful thing is, it can be adjusted on the root layer, and its child layer can be easily changed, and effect on root. The only reason I mention that is, smart object could be seen as a component, a variable, it is really efficient in our creation, even it can be creative. Symbol in AINo more Adobe!!! Well, as a designer, Symbol in Illustrator could be useful. It available artist set a symbol, and draw many symbol with different colours, size, angle of rotate, density. When we draw symbol on a satisfied position, we could refine the shape of symbol. Really useful. Javascript in HTMLSo many nonsense I wrote before, the only thing I want to say is 好像已经说过一次这话了 Variable or dynamic data is a model of work. We should manage well the relationship between different parts of component in project. For me, JS give me possibilities to change the outlook of Web, even available me make interaction for user and supply dynamic visual. nodeBoxNodeBox is a powerful tool to create dynamic graphic. It have a GUI face, so we can edit data with clear, simple way. In this work, I tried to use variable as ratio of shape, that means every shape would be created with a random way, but it keep a dynamic ratio, so it shows a motion of graphic. In this picture, these square are created with a dynamic ratio, the ratio was set as a Sin function, the value changed with frames. As we know, the min value of Sin() is -1， the max one is 1, so the value will be a loop. 我爱数学数学爱我(no)The interesting thing is, if I change even really small value of variable, it will make totally different visual language. NodeBox + PS/AENodebox can create random shape easily, it support the dynamic shape and variable can be changed. Furthermore, the shape can be rendered as frames, so they can be used as video. I created motion graphic in NodeBox, and translate to GIF image by PS. PS can quickly adjust layout and colours of elements, so it is possible to make digital poster by variable and motion graphic. The value of variable for a designIt’s no debt that it is difficult to control a variable, but it indeed support more possibilities for artist. Firstly, a dynamic design have more style, which can give unpredictable effect; Secondly, variable generally available user to interact with elements or interface, and visual could change when user give different operation, so it support interesting interactive experience; Thirdly, flexible variable can suit custom of user, such as change layout base on user’s devices, location, time and language.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[How designer does researchWhatever innovation must not be create from nothing, it must be developed or conducted by many basic theories or idea. Creation could constructed by original things, the important thing is to get existed thing to built new up. Therefore, it is vital to do research for a designer. Research is a way to find new idea, though it might be created by others, but as designer, we can translate the idea to own. Furthermore, it is necessary to collect evidence and theories to prove own work. Research can be enjoyableIn research seminar, two designers showed their idea about research and method to achieve a good development of work. But the important thing for me is, how to keep a positive attitude to do research, which means we should enjoy the process of research rather then complete an assignment. As Fiona said, the research in social media can improve the confidence of artists because they can get constructive feedback and gain more friends which have same interests. For me, do research on social media could not be a good idea because I generally be attracted by other things. The point I absolutely agree is that we should gain confidence and pleasure in the process of research. It might improve my ambition to realise new things or accept something I hadn’t agreed or understood. how do we do research in a happy experience?It’s no doubt that people always glad to do something might make self happy . To make self be happy, we should focus on something we interested. Unfortunately, sometimes the topic of subject could not the favourite one, even some theories are serious and boring. how can we change the attitude and be more excited in process of research? In my view, the key is synchronise with experiment. That’s means, when we are doing research, we should do some experiments and sketch or mind-map, so we can see the process of our thinking and understanding, we might get clear understanding, and it the result or outcome could make us be more confident, rather then a dozen of paper, so boring, isn’t it.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The separation of Chinese characterChinese character is hieroglyph, that means is Chinese character might made from different components which have specific means. For example, the word “grove” in Chinese character is made from two same components, which means “tree”, and the word “forest” in made from three “tree” components. Therefore, Chinese character can be separated to more general information. So, it is possible to visualise the meaning of Chinese character. Information reconstruction and visualizationAs I said, the composition of CC (Chinese character) could be understood independently, if I separate that can use specific visual elements to represent the individual component, then regroup these, it will be really interesting! It could represent a CC by different point, and people might understand CC by a original, visual method that means, the colour, structure, geometric shape or something could be the part of a reconstructive Chinese word. What kind of information can be separated and collected from Chinese character? Meaning of component Stroke count Construction The construction of a CC means, how do components group together, top and bottom, left and right, or left &amp; middle &amp; right, even around or special layout.

    <title><![CDATA[Research about M.Mohr]]></title>
    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F15%2FResearch-about-M-Mohr%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Research about Manfred MohrManfred Mohr is a pioneer of digital art. I saw his work in V&amp;A museum. His attitude for computer generated art is convincing and similar with me. As he said, I write computer algorithms i.e. rules that calculate and then generate the work which could not be realized in any other way. My artistic goal is reached when a finished work can dissociate itself from its logical content and stand convincingly as an independent abstract entity. Data and algorithms could be visualize, and computer can operate thousands of programmer to render the image that definitely hard to draw by hand. In addition, Mohr thought about the deeper form of digital art. His algorithms can render shape by particular way and create new composition of shape which means every elements exist in work could be different in composition and any other details. LOOKS COMPUTER COULD BE THINKING. Actually computer can’t thinking now, it merely doing something that have been set, but it can control variable to make every elements have tiny differences. Early work My early artistic work was influenced by atonal music, modern Jazz and abstract expressionism. As a consequence, geometry and the reduction of my visual vocabulary to black and white as binary decisions, took more and more importance in my work after 1963. As he said, he was inspired by atonal music and expressionism. It is really interesting, for me, music and expressionism both are emotional and abstract objects which are hard to describe by words or logical. But Mohr expressed these objects by computer, which have strict ruler and grammar in programmer. So, there is strong contrast in his work, because he used rational object convert to abstract information. Here are some early test of work and experiment of him: (Photo1) In this work, I can find his intention of express music and atone. To convey the unregulated and unordered tone, he drew some crooked border lines to represent tone in stave. I can guess it could the reason he used computer to draw random objects. In his drawing, I can see the difficulty of drawing absolutely random things, at most time we draw something with the order of brain, and the order generally is informative and conceive. (Photo2) This work showed a construction of lines. A nylon stocking is tear up and put on board. It shows different density of lines and negative space. To control the density of order, repeat and innocence thing can convey specific information. In 1969-1972, Mohr began to design algorithms to express his work. Image was printed by plotter which can be controlled by algorithm. A number of printer control languages were created to operate pen plotters, and transmit commands like “lift pen from paper”, “place pen on paper”, or “draw a line from here to here”. Three common ASCII-based plotter control languages are Hewlett-Packard’s HP-GL, its successor HP-GL/2 and Houston Instruments DMPL. Here is a simple HP-GL script drawing a line : SP1; PA500,500; PD; PR0,1000; PU; SP; This program instructs the plotter, in order, to take the first pen (SP1 = Select Pen 1), to go to coordinates X=500, Y=500 on the paper sheet (PA = Plot Absolute), to lower the pen against the paper (PD = Pen Down), to move 1000 units in the Y direction (thus drawing a vertical line - PR = Plot Relative), to lift the pen (PU = Pen Up) and finally to put it back in its stall. As we can see, early plotter has strict ruler and logical grammar. It should be given some order and parameter to draw image. data and parameter could convert to informative shape,can shape or words return to data? So it might be reconstructed and convey new means? In this idea, Chinese word could be dissociated to different stroke, pronunciation, stress and component which group up a word. In Chinese word, there are 4 stresses in pronunciation ruler, and most of character components (PianPang) have specific meanings, thats means, a Chinese word can be separated to be different words and meaning. Though it will lose the accuracy expression, it still convey part of original meaning and excess meaning. In later day, I would do deeper research about separation of Chinese character. (photo3) This work is made from vertical and horizon line, the horizon one is thicker so we can clear see that continuous line changed the direction. Actually the trace of line is random and controlled by algorithms. how long it go straight, how it change direction, when? The algorithms operate plotter to draw this image. It could be really interesting if we printed hundreds of it, the random walk of line, like a creature, smart and fool. (photo4) Random and variable can make complex composition, there are infinitive possibilities can be render, but the ruler is not changed, and the visual grammar is both same. In this point, the shape merely as a outcome, the algorithms could be art finally. A designer do not just create shape, it support a ruler, a model, a code. The elements are horizontal, vertical, 45 degree lines, square waves, zig-zags, and have probabilities for line widths and lengths.In each position on a very dense imaginary matrix, a sign is composed from 0-7 elements from the above alphabet.When 0 lines are chosen, a circle can be drawn having a randomly chosen radius and center. An image system in film could be made from similar elements, such as shape, structure and colours. These things combine with each other in an obscure (not obvious) way, but it indeed support a feeling or key that make all of elements connected. In addition, it makes association, because its ruler, grammar, way of composition. Using of image system in film factory Similar with image system, a computer-generated image could be made from series of elements which could be really simple, they group up with specific layout, and changed size or width, etc..]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F13%2FScreen-Printing%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Screen PrintingThe induction of screen printing is really interesting for me. Though I contacted screen printing before, heres tutor gave us many useful information. Steps to print The first step is clear the table and prepare a laysheet. That’s the paper we would print as outcome. And we must bring original work. We should place the original work to comfirm the position we print on laysheet. So we paste work (it generally is acid paper) Fixed by tape. Than we fix film board on print machine so it hard to move. A little tip is fold a paper and paste on laysheet, so it is available to move and adjust to a right position though the sheet will be covered by film board. The ink should be adjust to be wet and smooth that’s means it will not dry too quick. To confect (调制) a good quality ink, we should balance the ratio of acrylic medium and acrylic. Medium should be put into container at first, because it can available acrylic mixed completely. 50% medium and about 10g acrylic, and tiny other colours if we nee d mixed colour. 其实就挤三四陀就好了。 To print well, we should print ink equality, DO NOT print overly, it lose all of details of engraving. The most important thing is that if we print a multicolour work, the position of laysheet should be accuracy place. We use first work that took mark with laystops to guarantee that. Why use screen printing?Screen printing is a technique that print something have original details. Though it could print repeatedly, every times printing with different speeds or force might make different effect. Furthermore, the making of film board could be hand drawn that’s means some hand drawn illustrations can be use as film, and print to different colors. Different with digital creation, the process of making film could have tiny differences between original painting, so it will full of unpredictable details that really gorgeous for me.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F12%2FV-A-Classical-digital-work%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The arts of scienceWe are both rely on technology and smart devices today, and digital art or digital media have been really popluar in public sight. As designers, we generally use computer everyday, it is hard to imagine that how can I work when I leave computer. Did computer really support us to make incredible work? Is it REALLY VITAL THING in creation process? Or we merely rely on convient drawing or storage? It could make sence to understand early computer work and relieze how early computer artists thinking about art. In the early computer generated work, most of work could be made by mathematician or scientists, because they should operate complex progremmer on computer. Sometimes they did works with random shape or regular form, which could not be defined to an art work. If we focus on their process of working, we can find that they are trying to make computer to create something that generally repeat and change with some variable. As Manfred Mohr said, it is more important that develop a priori vocabulary which integrates the computer into the aesthethic system. As a tool, computer can make really fine image with actually a easy way. The more difficult thing is that how can we make computer create image as a CREATOR? That’s means computer should have the ability to create image that does’t create by hand. In fact, computer would ever create something from ZERO. It must opearte with some programmer that set by artist. In Manfred’s work, I saw some shape grouped with some specific method. These shape will be no sense if anyone out from group, and if they set in a matrix, we can see the visual grammer of work. Artist set a way that computer can create polyline and circle, and the quantity of point or length of line could be random, so every shape will have tiny differents but shows amazing variety. In this work, letters are printed as a strict format, like frame in frame. Computer always render some info from data bank by specific method, and the exsit of data could be visualization. Analyze the attribute or quantity of data, and render to more clear visual information. For illustration, artist could use tiny elements to make a bigger group, we collect different essential elements to imitate some situation and environment.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F10%2FThinkinkaboutresearch%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Discuss with researchAs an academic skill, research is the vital thing in my study process. In the begin of term, critical thinking and research have been the most important subject. Indeed, research for me was really helpful in the past projects.I collected others’ ideas and method to seek possibilities in my own work. Evenmore, research could be a tool that understand others’ opion or attitude. That’s means, a work developed by research, it might be more acceptable, because some parts of it were inspired from existent theories and knowledges. One of classmates do research by experience and travel real location to feel atmosphere. It would be more sensetive if we go somewhere and observe local objects. Not only take photos, but find out some details in building, environment and human culture. If we want to realize somewhere, it is a good way to stay there, merely do nothing. In my view, doing research not just take notes or sketch something, keeping thinking and being relax could be useful to inspired self. Another classmates said a question that always confused me that sometimes we usually don’t know WHY did we choose some colours in our work. Sometimes, we indeed like do somtings we would like to do, which without reasons. Evenmore, we found more evidence to demonstrate that. Although it could be a way to develop work, it is still not reasonable. As a designer, we should know the reason we choose some layout or colours, it can be logical and linear. So it is important to draft our project, when we have some satisfied scheme, we should do more research and realize why it is good, so we will get more clear mind to develop that. 🌚 Finally, somebody showed her FMP for us. They are some engraving works with gorgeous texture. And she pointed some special texture was created by ACCIDENT which made because of something broken. Fortunately, this accident made a really good shape with powerful trace. Charley said, we call it LUCKY ACCIDENT 😂😂😂 Is it means art need luck? Of course NO! The lucky girl said, she used some bad outcome which printed with unsatisfied texture, she developed by cut and refine the outline. She distinguished the quality of work, and did action research, so she could create better work than early one. Face own lose, find the reason than refine that Maybe reason could be the most important thing when we creating work, and research can help us to define the reason we choose. Cheers.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F09%2FFirst-day-in-V-A%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is the first day I begin my MA courseI went to V&amp;A museum, and saw some old computer generated works. It is AMAZING! At first, I cant believe that there are both digital work when I saw the date of creation. I said, it looks like a digital work! Of course they are, they definitely are, and they are the pioneer of digital arts! Cool! As Colette saids, “Grass is random and random is a natural computer facility. Computer grass is natural grass”(1980) Computer is really good at doing something random and repeat . It can do some thing repeatedly during hundred of thousand times, so something complex can be produce which could be a nightmare if did by someone. Random is beautiful, especially something changed with some regular. Something might be interesting because of tiny differences, that’s why some illustrators fall into creating some texture or brush-stroke. Some random variable can be set in computer and used to create delicate shape with thousands of possibilities. Next time, I might create some work about variable. As a future illustrator, I should use these variable or shape to convey some specific information. Popularity? Geography? Traffic? Whatever they are, a contemporary illustration work should support clearer meaning. Advanced animation technic and colours display could be my good tool to use. Cheers, for ancient computer and pioneers of digital arts.!]]></content>
