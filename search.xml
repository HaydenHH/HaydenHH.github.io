    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Pattern exportAfter finished the logical stage, I can get accurate data of Chinese Character, so I can generate graphic by these data. The after question is that, how can I form these words. Methodology of generation Translate each words to shape. Translate whole sentence, random choose some elements to build graphic. collect data and choose some of them to build whole typing words. Attribute of graphicTo build a group of graphic, each attribute of that should be defined by data which collected from user typing. I did a mindmap to clarify that: GraphicAbstractabstract shape like geometry graphic can represent some feeling or emotion that hard to describe, and it can be generate quickly, efficiently and easily. Objectspecific shape can be used to represent the radicals of character, because it can show real objects they are. So this attr might be supplied by Radical. FillThis attribute decide how this shape be filled and drawn. colortextrueTexture might be generated by bitmap or Noise patternHere I drew some pattern by AI, but in later project, it could be generated directly by Javascript, which support interaction with user. Formpositionsymmetry transformcomposeThis is a error, but it has strong visuals because of repetition and growth Content of projectThe original idea is showing visualisation of CC, by actually I can’t convey absolutely right information of word. Therefore, I might need an other form to express this project. A story? or A location which user can generate. For summary, user should get more aspiration to type rather than type something random. Here is a illustration I did..I’m improving this method of drawing.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reflection: CCV type-3WEB LINK After 5 days, I basically understood the using of p5.js 😃, so I continually refine the idea about visualisation of CC (Chinese Character). To definitely show the differences of characters, I chose Strokes counts to generate points and lines. In this article I will describe most progress and details. Point &amp; LineAs my early experiments, the words were analysed and render as SVG shape, and these shapes are similar with real symbol of tone. It can clearly show the tone of words, but my expectation is not only show Tone of word. Individual elements should connect each other, as same as the composition of sentence is words. To express the composition of sentence, I decided to use Lines as the format of compose. Which means every words will be translated to individual elements, and they connect and group as lines. Now, I would like to remember the process of create lines. Thinking process/ methodologyTwo points can be connected as a line. (两点一线)It is really clear, a creation of line in computer, should have two points, and each point should be marked as X &amp; Y. Therefore, I should provide X1,X2,Y1,Y2 to draw a line in programmer. line(x1,y1,x2,y2) So, I tried to make groups of points, which base on Stroke of count. CCV type-2Here is the first outcome of Points, the quantity of points equal the strokes count of word. To be honest, it is really simple, even ugly. However, the only reason I did that is, I try to successfully create right counts of point. CCV type-2+Next step, I connected every points, by lines. There are many developments on logical stage, I will list that but it is so complex to clarify every things(太懒了，解释不清): Wrap 换行 Javascript Object Loop render 实时渲染 Actually, it is more ugly than I did before. Firstly, black is too thick when it shows on dense lines. Secondly, the order of points is too regular, so these lines create many sharp negative room, which make too strong contrast. So bad. 辣眼睛啊. CCV type-3. Curve! Bezier curve!To save my ** thick work, I decided to use curve, beautiful curve. Different with hand-draw curve, computer actually not good at draw curve. Thank for great mathematicians,(对不起，王老师，杨老师，熊老师我没学好数学) we indeed have method to let computer render curve. One of that, is Bezier curve**. It means, we can set handles to control the curve of line.Bezier Curve edit tool bezierCurve(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4) //x2,y2;x3,y3; mean the points of handle. DecorationAs MA IVM student, it is impossible to work without decoration. Actually, not only decoration, but also for better interaction and communication of user. In this step, I begin to consider the outlook of webpage, such as colour, layout, interaction and performance. colourI changed the colour of background to show more strong curves. download original image on Dropbox layoutCurrently, there are some questions need to develop: Input might be available to move with viewpoint, so user can preview the image when they are typing. Button extremely need to improve! Difficult to understand, ugly style. 天啊. Poem bank should be easier to use, and I might be should add more one box to show the content, so user can save more time.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What’s poor imagePoor image generally are low quality digital image, which means it is defined base on sharpness and resolution. In Defense of the Poor Image Poor image could be more Rich Poor image contain experimental and artistic materials but also incredible amounts of porn and paranoia. They are popular that can be made and seen by the many They are easier communicated and stored. There are more people can read poor image because its cheap cost. In addition, everyone can edit image, so people will reedit image to be suitable for themselves. Poor image give more possibilities whatever good or bad多样性！variousDigital images are saved by different format and attribute generally but they will lose resolution when they are translated to different format. Furthermore, with editing of users or read, original images might be changed with different style such as colours or tone. After hundreds circulation, it could change to a completely different situation. 盗版不想说太多。反正就是盗版资料可能改变了影响了原作对社会的影响。 in the age of file-sharing, marginalised content circulates again and reconnect dispersed worldwide audiences. poor images are shared in Internet, increase the speed of dispersion and communication. Because of it can be free, it expand the viewing realityThe poor image could not be same as original, it changed situation, information of image: swarm, circulation, digital dispersion(分散，散布), fractured(破裂) and flexible. After personal editing, original works are realised and destructed by individual methods, so poor images are not original. Idea!The contrast between original image and poor image could be represented by vector image and bitmaps graphic. It might have strong visual. Poor images are deconstructed by many person as their opinion. So there are infinitive possibilities to change/ edit, understand an original work. In my project, the original information user supported will be translated as their customs. Glitch artSometimes, compression artefact could create some special effect s which have strong style. There are different type of format in compression artefact: Aliasing 混叠 Blur, which include motion blur, defocus blur. Defocus blur include 镜外失焦，湍流 turbulence, 短曝光失焦 Block boundary artefacts Noice 噪点 Glitch art generally are generated by high saturation colours and geometric shape. It could be imitated by simple programmer.I did a test web by P5.js as the experiment of my project. User can draw block with the motion of mouse.Drawing!]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Get stroke countsAfter last tutorial, Ive continually developed the Web project. I added new function to get the strokes of words which user typed. Then I would like to reflect the hold process, what difficulties I faced, the idea I got, and the methodology of reach. Retrieve databaseThe principle of analyse data actually just search database, which means every element I might use, have existed in database, it could be prepared or made in time. It is easy to get data, such as stroke counts of word, but the difficult thing is to translate that to a new data, which can be used to generated shape. Data-driven shapeData-driven graphic design 32p: “Unlike the physical process of making a mark with a pen, brush, or even a digital tablet, computational drawings are created by a written list of programming instructions based on rules and procedures that a programmer writes, a computer translates and executes the instructions into individual marks lines, and shapes on the screen.” Computer generate different graphic base on the data have supported. In current stage, I want to use ‘Stroke’ to effect the format of graphic, which means how shapes group up and how they connect each other. The reason I thought is, Chinese word s sometimes have big differences in structure and strokes, it will effect visuals. The strokes will influence the complexity of the outlook, though it is irrelative to meaning generally, it can clear show different characteristics of words Make points as coordinateI create a series of points by strokes count of each word, so every word will have some points which can be the coordinate. In future work, some specific shape could be set in the coordinate. Furthermore, basing on different Tone, the layout of point could be changed, because Strokes merely influence the quantity of points. render graphic base on different coordinate of each wordsThe question is, I haven’t decided which way I render graphic. There are two method to render graphic I can use now, SVG, render by Snap.js Bitmap, render by P5.js SVG available me to create more beautiful/ delicate shape with high-quality resolution. And Bitmap graphic can generate more curve and massive geometric shape. In future work I will do that both and choose one or both as final effect. The difficulties I faced nowdata analyse在早期进程中，变量的提取非常困难，尤其是我需要逐个把用户键入的字符匹配数据库，当匹配数据库后，再分析它的别的属性。逻辑层面必须非常清晰：用户键入————每一个字————属性，如笔画读音偏旁拼音，检索音调；笔画————生成坐标，坐标————通过笔画数判断坐标数量，通过别的属性决定坐标排列方式偏旁，检索特定的含义，其含义必须被单独设定，手动 whole styleThe work must be designed to illustrative, it should give the feeling of words, it doesn’t represent a whole sentence, but it should show the abstract meaning of words.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F25%2FReflection-Early-visualisation-of-Chinese%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Reflection: Early experiments about visualisationIn this stage, I’ve done a prototype of visualisation application, it available user to support dynamic data and translate to geometric shape. I used JavaScript to build the application as well as NodeBox and illustrator. Then I will review the process of work. Source of ideaAt first, we visited the V&amp;A museum, there are series of digital arts exhibited. I observed the layout and variant of graphic, but was confused by the irregular shape. I tired to find the reason and the meaning of artists want to convey. I failed. 这些数字渲染的作品充满了不确定性和随机性，但是不变的是他们的排列方式。艺术家用特殊的算法计算了图形的位置，并通过控制变量的方法让图形拥有不同的形状或者结构。 In M.Mohr’s work, I saw his algorithm generate shape as random symbol, they are ordered in grid system with a tiny translation of position. So I want to collect information and data as variable to generate more specific shape. I chose Chinese letter as the source of information, because Chinese letter can be separated to be different parts which have individual meanings. Work processTo complete my idea, it is important to distinguish the letter. I set a database, it will return the value of phonogram, stroke count, radical of letter whatever user type are( except special/strange word or symbol ). After return of data, I used JS to analyse that and change the image which show on Web. 通过的采集的数据的分析，再遍历数据库，当有匹配对象的时候，返回它的详细信息，例如拼音，笔画和部首。 通过拆分返回的拼音字符串，再遍历每个字符串，与音调的数据库匹配，返回后即可以得到那个有音调的拼音所属于的音调。 Base on the tone of letters, specific shape will be set on Web. The method of render image is add and append tag in DOM as &lt;embed src=Dynamic link&gt;svg img&lt;/embed&gt; GoodthingTo see a draft effect, I chose tone as variable to make graphic. I successful complete the logical stage (逻辑层面). Though it just show tone as characteristic of a word, it is easily to add more effect on shape. It clearly shows the differences of Chinese character which same as my first expectation Something need to developMore illustrativeI used shape of symbol to show the tone of word, which is same as we daily use. But the final outcome should not be the showing of symbol. The expression of tone might be a method/ structure when rendering shape. So, they the variable from tones should have the ability that show the change of tone/ level. Curve might be a good choice. In future work, there will more information be add in graphic, but how should I keep a balance? What’s the composition of individual graphic?]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Draft: Dynamic visualisation of Tone of Chinese letterWEB Link As I said, Chinese is a language use tone to define meaning of word, so a same spell/ pronunciation will have definitely different meaning if they have different tone. I’ve did a draft of Web, it available user to type Chinese and get individual Tone. In future work, user will get more information, such as radicals and stroke count, they will both be series variable to create geometric shape. Tone of wordThere are four tones in Chinese pronunciation system: Level tone (平声) Rising tone Falling-rising tone Falling tone (去声) It is complex compare with western language, different tone decide different meaning of words, so there are some difficulties in communication. Even in local communication, people could be confused when they talk with others who use different accent. There are so many accent in south of China, and they could use different tone in pronunciation system. It is impossible to use geometric shape to represent word, but in this project, I want find commonness(共性） of parts of word, so I want to summarise the character of different tone in pronunciation, and how can I use graphic language to convey the meaning of parts of Chinese word. Characteristic of toneLevel ToneLevel Tone is smooth and stable tone, but sometimes it decide the basic tone of a sentence. So it might be represent begin, it could be changed depends on the emotion of speaker. Therefore, it could be a random colours in the begin of sentence. Rising ToneWith the increasing of tone, the length of pronunciation is rise too. So it is clearly that we could use Rising gradient colours to express that. On the other hand, it could give people the feeling of slow down because of the length of pronunciation is longer than other tone. So I might find some elements to convey the feeling of slow. Falling-Rising ToneIt a change of direction. The first idea is contrast colours to represent this tone. Such as the contrast Hue, lightness of colours. Falling ToneIt should be quick and heavy. When people pronounciate falling tone, they generally emphasise the stress of word, a falling tone could have strong emotion and expression.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Start at P5.jsMost digital artists might realize about Processing, which can make good data driven design. However, it made by Java, so it merely run on 模拟器(simulators) , it is not convenient to suitable different devices today. So, P5 is a good replacement, it base on Javascript so most devices such as mobile desktop both run it. What does P5 do?Same as processing, it drive data to generate graphic. It generate shape in canvas element, so it makes bitmap graphics basically. advanced aspectsaccessibilityIt base on Javascript so most devices support to run P5 scripts. Furthermore, it is super easy to write! It has Event function which can continue monitor and return the position of mouse, so shapes can be dynamic and changed or move with the operation of user. High performanceBitmap graphics are suitable to generated massively, different with SVG in html, bitmap graphics not add DOM, so it can be rendered quickly.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Seminar: method of researchTranslating between different media, in different filed. Projectpractice based researchDo practice as research, collect experience and knowledge in experiment. Think about WHY, Why you, why now benefit from course institution and fund application as PhD working process, some outcome or inspiration could come from different work/ research, it is a loop, artist should consider before work process, and make reflective development. The elements in research process could be considered as different way, it depends what background/ context it comes from. A artist should connect different elements as narrative group to support information. We see the graphic in image, and analyse the background, story, history of image. What is documentIn my view: Document could be the article which made with description, image or reference. It show something clear, and can be saved individual. It should be sorted. Tomas Keenan and Hito Steyler give some description.To teach, evidentiary proof, They are contested, meanings explored and contrasted. We have experienced a shift from the document as evidence, to the document as trigger and catalyst of events Primary sources P research is original record. Secondary sources Writing and understanding from primary sources. How Analysis description Things I feel are evoked by or associated with the artefact Why chose Strength and shortcomings Analysis This work shows a group of symbols. Although they look irregular, actually they are made by strict algorithms that means computer render them by a specific programmer or ruler. This work can be remade thousands times without once completely same group, but they are made with same visual language . The key point in this work is variable which means the work base on essential elements, and they grouped with random way, because of variable. The reason I appreciate this work is, variable available us to create a work which can be dynamic and random. It can convey multiple emotions and information, because different users might have individual information, so a dynamic work could bring more specific feelings. This work is made by circles and poly line, they order by algorithm and changed with variable. It shows a strong visual, but it has supported more specific information, that means it merely show graphic and regular, rather then represent a emotion or story. It is only shape. Therefore, in my work, I would like to draw more informative graphic which might show more potential feeling.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F22%2FThink-about-Variable-in-art-creation%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Thinking about VariablesIn digital creation, variable could be really important. It is generally used to replace a value, which could change between different individuals. Such as colours, size, position, count, ratio, etc… It makes work looks various and interesting (我真不知道丰富的英文怎么写). So, the topic is, why we use variable in design rather then fixed value, and does ‘random’ really interested user? Method of making a dynamic art workThe word ‘dynamic’ here means something could change easily and quickly. For example, Photoshop might be the best friend of us no🙃, the ‘smart object’ could be used in a high frequency. It can show the graphic as one layer, which could be combine with multiply layer. The useful thing is, it can be adjusted on the root layer, and its child layer can be easily changed, and effect on root. The only reason I mention that is, smart object could be seen as a component, a variable, it is really efficient in our creation, even it can be creative. Symbol in AINo more Adobe!!! Well, as a designer, Symbol in Illustrator could be useful. It available artist set a symbol, and draw many symbol with different colours, size, angle of rotate, density. When we draw symbol on a satisfied position, we could refine the shape of symbol. Really useful. Javascript in HTMLSo many nonsense I wrote before, the only thing I want to say is 好像已经说过一次这话了 Variable or dynamic data is a model of work. We should manage well the relationship between different parts of component in project. For me, JS give me possibilities to change the outlook of Web, even available me make interaction for user and supply dynamic visual. nodeBoxNodeBox is a powerful tool to create dynamic graphic. It have a GUI face, so we can edit data with clear, simple way. In this work, I tried to use variable as ratio of shape, that means every shape would be created with a random way, but it keep a dynamic ratio, so it shows a motion of graphic. In this picture, these square are created with a dynamic ratio, the ratio was set as a Sin function, the value changed with frames. As we know, the min value of Sin() is -1， the max one is 1, so the value will be a loop. 我爱数学数学爱我(no)The interesting thing is, if I change even really small value of variable, it will make totally different visual language. NodeBox + PS/AENodebox can create random shape easily, it support the dynamic shape and variable can be changed. Furthermore, the shape can be rendered as frames, so they can be used as video. I created motion graphic in NodeBox, and translate to GIF image by PS. PS can quickly adjust layout and colours of elements, so it is possible to make digital poster by variable and motion graphic. The value of variable for a designIt’s no debt that it is difficult to control a variable, but it indeed support more possibilities for artist. Firstly, a dynamic design have more style, which can give unpredictable effect; Secondly, variable generally available user to interact with elements or interface, and visual could change when user give different operation, so it support interesting interactive experience; Thirdly, flexible variable can suit custom of user, such as change layout base on user’s devices, location, time and language.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F17%2FHow-artist-do-research%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[How designer does researchWhatever innovation must not be create from nothing, it must be developed or conducted by many basic theories or idea. Creation could constructed by original things, the important thing is to get existed thing to built new up. Therefore, it is vital to do research for a designer. Research is a way to find new idea, though it might be created by others, but as designer, we can translate the idea to own. Furthermore, it is necessary to collect evidence and theories to prove own work. Research can be enjoyableIn research seminar, two designers showed their idea about research and method to achieve a good development of work. But the important thing for me is, how to keep a positive attitude to do research, which means we should enjoy the process of research rather then complete an assignment. As Fiona said, the research in social media can improve the confidence of artists because they can get constructive feedback and gain more friends which have same interests. For me, do research on social media could not be a good idea because I generally be attracted by other things. The point I absolutely agree is that we should gain confidence and pleasure in the process of research. It might improve my ambition to realise new things or accept something I hadn’t agreed or understood. how do we do research in a happy experience?It’s no doubt that people always glad to do something might make self happy . To make self be happy, we should focus on something we interested. Unfortunately, sometimes the topic of subject could not the favourite one, even some theories are serious and boring. how can we change the attitude and be more excited in process of research? In my view, the key is synchronise with experiment. That’s means, when we are doing research, we should do some experiments and sketch or mind-map, so we can see the process of our thinking and understanding, we might get clear understanding, and it the result or outcome could make us be more confident, rather then a dozen of paper, so boring, isn’t it.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The separation of Chinese characterChinese character is hieroglyph, that means is Chinese character might made from different components which have specific means. For example, the word “grove” in Chinese character is made from two same components, which means “tree”, and the word “forest” in made from three “tree” components. Therefore, Chinese character can be separated to more general information. So, it is possible to visualise the meaning of Chinese character. Information reconstruction and visualizationAs I said, the composition of CC (Chinese character) could be understood independently, if I separate that can use specific visual elements to represent the individual component, then regroup these, it will be really interesting! It could represent a CC by different point, and people might understand CC by a original, visual method that means, the colour, structure, geometric shape or something could be the part of a reconstructive Chinese word. What kind of information can be separated and collected from Chinese character? Meaning of component Stroke count Construction The construction of a CC means, how do components group together, top and bottom, left and right, or left &amp; middle &amp; right, even around or special layout.

We had reaped the rewards of what art historian Jennifer Roberts has called“deceleration, patience and immersive attention.”1 To her students at Harvard, Roberts assigned the task of spending three whole hours in front of the John Singleton Copley painting Boy with a Squirrel. It was an exercise that Roberts herself had performed in her study of the painting, an act of temporal largesse that had yielded insights not readily available in any single passing look.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Research about Manfred MohrManfred Mohr is a pioneer of digital art. I saw his work in V&amp;A museum. His attitude for computer generated art is convincing and similar with me. As he said, I write computer algorithms i.e. rules that calculate and then generate the work which could not be realized in any other way. My artistic goal is reached when a finished work can dissociate itself from its logical content and stand convincingly as an independent abstract entity. Data and algorithms could be visualize, and computer can operate thousands of programmer to render the image that definitely hard to draw by hand. In addition, Mohr thought about the deeper form of digital art. His algorithms can render shape by particular way and create new composition of shape which means every elements exist in work could be different in composition and any other details. LOOKS COMPUTER COULD BE THINKING. Actually computer can’t thinking now, it merely doing something that have been set, but it can control variable to make every elements have tiny differences. Early work My early artistic work was influenced by atonal music, modern Jazz and abstract expressionism. As a consequence, geometry and the reduction of my visual vocabulary to black and white as binary decisions, took more and more importance in my work after 1963. As he said, he was inspired by atonal music and expressionism. It is really interesting, for me, music and expressionism both are emotional and abstract objects which are hard to describe by words or logical. But Mohr expressed these objects by computer, which have strict ruler and grammar in programmer. So, there is strong contrast in his work, because he used rational object convert to abstract information. Here are some early test of work and experiment of him: (Photo1) In this work, I can find his intention of express music and atone. To convey the unregulated and unordered tone, he drew some crooked border lines to represent tone in stave. I can guess it could the reason he used computer to draw random objects. In his drawing, I can see the difficulty of drawing absolutely random things, at most time we draw something with the order of brain, and the order generally is informative and conceive. (Photo2) This work showed a construction of lines. A nylon stocking is tear up and put on board. It shows different density of lines and negative space. To control the density of order, repeat and innocence thing can convey specific information. In 1969-1972, Mohr began to design algorithms to express his work. Image was printed by plotter which can be controlled by algorithm. A number of printer control languages were created to operate pen plotters, and transmit commands like “lift pen from paper”, “place pen on paper”, or “draw a line from here to here”. Three common ASCII-based plotter control languages are Hewlett-Packard’s HP-GL, its successor HP-GL/2 and Houston Instruments DMPL. Here is a simple HP-GL script drawing a line : SP1; PA500,500; PD; PR0,1000; PU; SP; This program instructs the plotter, in order, to take the first pen (SP1 = Select Pen 1), to go to coordinates X=500, Y=500 on the paper sheet (PA = Plot Absolute), to lower the pen against the paper (PD = Pen Down), to move 1000 units in the Y direction (thus drawing a vertical line - PR = Plot Relative), to lift the pen (PU = Pen Up) and finally to put it back in its stall. As we can see, early plotter has strict ruler and logical grammar. It should be given some order and parameter to draw image. data and parameter could convert to informative shape,can shape or words return to data? So it might be reconstructed and convey new means? In this idea, Chinese word could be dissociated to different stroke, pronunciation, stress and component which group up a word. In Chinese word, there are 4 stresses in pronunciation ruler, and most of character components (PianPang) have specific meanings, thats means, a Chinese word can be separated to be different words and meaning. Though it will lose the accuracy expression, it still convey part of original meaning and excess meaning. In later day, I would do deeper research about separation of Chinese character. (photo3) This work is made from vertical and horizon line, the horizon one is thicker so we can clear see that continuous line changed the direction. Actually the trace of line is random and controlled by algorithms. how long it go straight, how it change direction, when? The algorithms operate plotter to draw this image. It could be really interesting if we printed hundreds of it, the random walk of line, like a creature, smart and fool. (photo4) Random and variable can make complex composition, there are infinitive possibilities can be render, but the ruler is not changed, and the visual grammar is both same. In this point, the shape merely as a outcome, the algorithms could be art finally. A designer do not just create shape, it support a ruler, a model, a code. The elements are horizontal, vertical, 45 degree lines, square waves, zig-zags, and have probabilities for line widths and lengths.In each position on a very dense imaginary matrix, a sign is composed from 0-7 elements from the above alphabet.When 0 lines are chosen, a circle can be drawn having a randomly chosen radius and center. An image system in film could be made from similar elements, such as shape, structure and colours. These things combine with each other in an obscure (not obvious) way, but it indeed support a feeling or key that make all of elements connected. In addition, it makes association, because its ruler, grammar, way of composition. Using of image system in film factory Similar with image system, a computer-generated image could be made from series of elements which could be really simple, they group up with specific layout, and changed size or width, etc..]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F13%2FScreen-Printing%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Screen PrintingThe induction of screen printing is really interesting for me. Though I contacted screen printing before, heres tutor gave us many useful information. Steps to print The first step is clear the table and prepare a laysheet. That’s the paper we would print as outcome. And we must bring original work. We should place the original work to comfirm the position we print on laysheet. So we paste work (it generally is acid paper) Fixed by tape. Than we fix film board on print machine so it hard to move. A little tip is fold a paper and paste on laysheet, so it is available to move and adjust to a right position though the sheet will be covered by film board. The ink should be adjust to be wet and smooth that’s means it will not dry too quick. To confect (调制) a good quality ink, we should balance the ratio of acrylic medium and acrylic. Medium should be put into container at first, because it can available acrylic mixed completely. 50% medium and about 10g acrylic, and tiny other colours if we nee d mixed colour. 其实就挤三四陀就好了。 To print well, we should print ink equality, DO NOT print overly, it lose all of details of engraving. The most important thing is that if we print a multicolour work, the position of laysheet should be accuracy place. We use first work that took mark with laystops to guarantee that. Why use screen printing?Screen printing is a technique that print something have original details. Though it could print repeatedly, every times printing with different speeds or force might make different effect. Furthermore, the making of film board could be hand drawn that’s means some hand drawn illustrations can be use as film, and print to different colors. Different with digital creation, the process of making film could have tiny differences between original painting, so it will full of unpredictable details that really gorgeous for me.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[V&A Classical digital work]]></title>
    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F12%2FV-A-Classical-digital-work%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The arts of scienceWe are both rely on technology and smart devices today, and digital art or digital media have been really popluar in public sight. As designers, we generally use computer everyday, it is hard to imagine that how can I work when I leave computer. Did computer really support us to make incredible work? Is it REALLY VITAL THING in creation process? Or we merely rely on convient drawing or storage? It could make sence to understand early computer work and relieze how early computer artists thinking about art. In the early computer generated work, most of work could be made by mathematician or scientists, because they should operate complex progremmer on computer. Sometimes they did works with random shape or regular form, which could not be defined to an art work. If we focus on their process of working, we can find that they are trying to make computer to create something that generally repeat and change with some variable. As Manfred Mohr said, it is more important that develop a priori vocabulary which integrates the computer into the aesthethic system. As a tool, computer can make really fine image with actually a easy way. The more difficult thing is that how can we make computer create image as a CREATOR? That’s means computer should have the ability to create image that does’t create by hand. In fact, computer would ever create something from ZERO. It must opearte with some programmer that set by artist. In Manfred’s work, I saw some shape grouped with some specific method. These shape will be no sense if anyone out from group, and if they set in a matrix, we can see the visual grammer of work. Artist set a way that computer can create polyline and circle, and the quantity of point or length of line could be random, so every shape will have tiny differents but shows amazing variety. In this work, letters are printed as a strict format, like frame in frame. Computer always render some info from data bank by specific method, and the exsit of data could be visualization. Analyze the attribute or quantity of data, and render to more clear visual information. For illustration, artist could use tiny elements to make a bigger group, we collect different essential elements to imitate some situation and environment.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Thinking about research]]></title>
    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F10%2FThinkinkaboutresearch%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Discuss with researchAs an academic skill, research is the vital thing in my study process. In the begin of term, critical thinking and research have been the most important subject. Indeed, research for me was really helpful in the past projects.I collected others’ ideas and method to seek possibilities in my own work. Evenmore, research could be a tool that understand others’ opion or attitude. That’s means, a work developed by research, it might be more acceptable, because some parts of it were inspired from existent theories and knowledges. One of classmates do research by experience and travel real location to feel atmosphere. It would be more sensetive if we go somewhere and observe local objects. Not only take photos, but find out some details in building, environment and human culture. If we want to realize somewhere, it is a good way to stay there, merely do nothing. In my view, doing research not just take notes or sketch something, keeping thinking and being relax could be useful to inspired self. Another classmates said a question that always confused me that sometimes we usually don’t know WHY did we choose some colours in our work. Sometimes, we indeed like do somtings we would like to do, which without reasons. Evenmore, we found more evidence to demonstrate that. Although it could be a way to develop work, it is still not reasonable. As a designer, we should know the reason we choose some layout or colours, it can be logical and linear. So it is important to draft our project, when we have some satisfied scheme, we should do more research and realize why it is good, so we will get more clear mind to develop that. 🌚 Finally, somebody showed her FMP for us. They are some engraving works with gorgeous texture. And she pointed some special texture was created by ACCIDENT which made because of something broken. Fortunately, this accident made a really good shape with powerful trace. Charley said, we call it LUCKY ACCIDENT 😂😂😂 Is it means art need luck? Of course NO! The lucky girl said, she used some bad outcome which printed with unsatisfied texture, she developed by cut and refine the outline. She distinguished the quality of work, and did action research, so she could create better work than early one. Face own lose, find the reason than refine that Maybe reason could be the most important thing when we creating work, and research can help us to define the reason we choose. Cheers.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is the first day I begin my MA courseI went to V&amp;A museum, and saw some old computer generated works. It is AMAZING! At first, I cant believe that there are both digital work when I saw the date of creation. I said, it looks like a digital work! Of course they are, they definitely are, and they are the pioneer of digital arts! Cool! As Colette saids, “Grass is random and random is a natural computer facility. Computer grass is natural grass”(1980) Computer is really good at doing something random and repeat . It can do some thing repeatedly during hundred of thousand times, so something complex can be produce which could be a nightmare if did by someone. Random is beautiful, especially something changed with some regular. Something might be interesting because of tiny differences, that’s why some illustrators fall into creating some texture or brush-stroke. Some random variable can be set in computer and used to create delicate shape with thousands of possibilities. Next time, I might create some work about variable. As a future illustrator, I should use these variable or shape to convey some specific information. Popularity? Geography? Traffic? Whatever they are, a contemporary illustration work should support clearer meaning. Advanced animation technic and colours display could be my good tool to use. Cheers, for ancient computer and pioneers of digital arts.!]]></content>
