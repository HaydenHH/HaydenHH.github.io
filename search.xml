I added new function to get the strokes of words which user typed.

In current stage, I want to use ‘Stroke’ to effect the <strong>format of graphic</strong>, which means how shapes group up and how they connect each other. The reason I thought is, Chinese word s sometimes have big differences in structure and strokes, it will effect visuals. The strokes will influence the <strong>complexity of the outlook, though it is irrelative to meaning generally, it can clear show different characteristics of words</strong></p><h4 id="Make-points-as-coordinate"><a href="#Make-points-as-coordinate" class="headerlink" title="Make points as coordinate"></a>Make points as coordinate</h4><p>I create a series of points by strokes count of each word, so every word will have some points which can be the <strong>coordinate</strong>. In future work, some specific shape could be set in the coordinate.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Reflection-Early-experiments-about-visualisation"><a href="#Reflection-Early-experiments-about-visualisation" class="headerlink" title="Reflection: Early experiments about visualisation"></a>Reflection: Early experiments about visualisation</h1><p>In this stage, I’ve done a prototype of visualisation application, it available user to support dynamic data and translate to geometric shape. I used JavaScript to build the application as well as NodeBox and illustrator. Then I will review the process of work.</p><h2 id="Source-of-idea"><a href="#Source-of-idea" class="headerlink" title="Source of idea"></a>Source of idea</h2><p>At first, we visited the V&amp;A museum, there are series of digital arts exhibited. I observed the layout and variant of graphic, but was confused by the irregular shape. I tired to find the reason and the meaning of artists want to convey. I failed.</p><p>这些数字渲染的作品充满了不确定性和随机性，但是不变的是他们的排列方式。艺术家用特殊的算法计算了图形的位置，并通过控制变量的方法让图形拥有不同的形状或者结构。</p><p>In M.Mohr’s work, I saw his algorithm generate shape as random symbol, they are ordered in grid system with a tiny translation of position. So I want to collect information and data as variable to generate more specific shape. I chose Chinese letter as the source of information, because Chinese letter can be separated to be different parts which have individual meanings.</p><h2 id="Work-process"><a href="#Work-process" class="headerlink" title="Work process"></a>Work process</h2><p>To complete my idea, it is important to <strong>distinguish</strong> the letter. I set a database, it will return the value of <strong>phonogram, stroke count, radical</strong> of letter whatever user type are( except special/strange word or symbol ).</p><p>After return of data, I used JS to analyse that and change the image which show on Web.</p><p>通过的采集的数据的分析，再遍历数据库，当有匹配对象的时候，返回它的详细信息，例如<strong>拼音，笔画和部首</strong>。 通过拆分返回的拼音字符串，再遍历每个字符串，与音调的数据库匹配，返回后即可以得到那个有音调的拼音所属于的音调。</p><img src="/2018/10/25/Reflection-Early-visualisation-of-Chinese/photo1.png"><p>Base on the tone of letters, specific shape will be set on Web. The method of render image is add and append tag in DOM as</p><pre><code>&lt;embed src=Dynamic link&gt;svg img&lt;/embed&gt;</code></pre><h2 id="Goodthing"><a href="#Goodthing" class="headerlink" title="Goodthing"></a>Goodthing</h2><p>To see a draft effect, I chose tone as variable to make graphic. I successful complete the logical stage (逻辑层面). Though it just show tone as characteristic of a word, it is easily to add more effect on shape. It clearly shows the differences of Chinese character which same as my first expectation</p><h2 id="Something-need-to-develop"><a href="#Something-need-to-develop" class="headerlink" title="Something need to develop"></a>Something need to develop</h2><h3 id="More-illustrative"><a href="#More-illustrative" class="headerlink" title="More illustrative"></a>More illustrative</h3><p>I used shape of symbol to show the tone of word, which is same as we daily use. But the final outcome should not be the showing  of symbol. The expression of tone might be a <strong>method/ structure</strong> when rendering shape. So, they the variable from tones should have the ability that show the change of tone/ level. <strong>Curve</strong> might be a good choice.</p><p>In future work, there will more information be add in graphic, but how should I keep a balance? What’s the composition of individual graphic? </p>]]></content>

In future work, user will get more information, such as radicals and stroke count, they will both be series variable to create geometric shape.</p><img src="/2018/10/24/Draft-Visualizetion-of-tone-of-Chinese-word/photo1.gif"><h2 id="Tone-of-word"><a href="#Tone-of-word" class="headerlink" title="Tone of word"></a>Tone of word</h2><p>There are four tones in Chinese pronunciation system:</p><ul><li>Level tone (平声)</li><li>Rising tone </li><li>Falling-rising tone</li><li>Falling tone (去声) </li></ul><p>It is complex compare with western language, different tone decide different meaning of words, so there are some difficulties in communication. Even in local communication, people could be confused when they talk with others who use different accent. There are so many accent in south of China, and they could use different tone in pronunciation system. </p><p>It is impossible to use geometric shape to represent word, but in this project, I want find <strong>commonness(共性）</strong> of parts of word, so I want to summarise the character of different tone in pronunciation, and how can I use graphic language to convey the meaning of parts of Chinese word.</p><h2 id="Characteristic-of-tone"><a href="#Characteristic-of-tone" class="headerlink" title="Characteristic of tone"></a>Characteristic of tone</h2><h3 id="Level-Tone"><a href="#Level-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Level Tone"></a>Level Tone</h3><p><em>Level Tone</em> is smooth and stable tone, but sometimes it decide the basic tone of a sentence. So it might be represent <strong>begin</strong>, it could be changed depends on the emotion of speaker. Therefore, it could be a random colours in the begin of sentence.</p><h3 id="Rising-Tone"><a href="#Rising-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Rising Tone"></a>Rising Tone</h3><p>With the increasing of tone, the length of pronunciation is rise  too. So it is clearly that we could use Rising gradient colours to express that. On the other hand, it could give people the feeling of slow down because of the length of pronunciation is longer than other tone. So I might find some elements to convey the feeling of slow.</p><h3 id="Falling-Rising-Tone"><a href="#Falling-Rising-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Falling-Rising Tone"></a>Falling-Rising Tone</h3><p>It a change of direction. The first idea is <strong>contrast colours</strong>  to represent this tone. Such as the contrast Hue, lightness of colours.</p><h3 id="Falling-Tone"><a href="#Falling-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Falling Tone"></a>Falling Tone</h3><p>It should be quick and heavy. When people pronounciate falling tone, they generally emphasise the stress of word, a falling tone could have strong emotion and expression. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Thinking-about-Variables"><a href="#Thinking-about-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Thinking about Variables"></a>Thinking about Variables</h1><p>In digital creation, variable could be really important. It is generally used to replace a value, which could change between different individuals.<a id="more"></a> Such as colours, size, position, count, ratio, etc… It makes work looks various and interesting <del>(我真不知道丰富的英文怎么写)</del>. So, the topic is, why we use variable in design rather then fixed value, and does ‘random’ really interested user?</p><h2 id="Method-of-making-a-dynamic-art-work"><a href="#Method-of-making-a-dynamic-art-work" class="headerlink" title="Method of making a dynamic art work"></a>Method of making a dynamic art work</h2><p>The word ‘dynamic’ here means something could change easily and quickly. For example, Photoshop might be the best friend of us <del>no🙃</del>, the ‘smart object’ could be used in a high frequency. It can show the graphic as one layer, which could be combine with multiply layer. The useful thing is, it can be adjusted on the root layer, and its child layer can be easily changed, and effect on root. The only reason I mention that is, smart object could be seen as a component, a variable, it is really efficient in our creation, even it can be creative.</p><h3 id="Symbol-in-AI"><a href="#Symbol-in-AI" class="headerlink" title="Symbol in AI"></a>Symbol in AI</h3><p><del>No more Adobe!!!</del> Well, as a designer, Symbol in Illustrator could be useful. It available artist set a symbol, and draw many symbol with different colours, size, angle of rotate, density. When we draw symbol on a satisfied position, we could refine the  shape of symbol. Really useful.</p><h3 id="Javascript-in-HTML"><a href="#Javascript-in-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Javascript in HTML"></a>Javascript in HTML</h3><p>So many nonsense I wrote before, the only thing I want to say is <del>好像已经说过一次这话了</del> Variable or dynamic data is a model of work. We should manage well the relationship between different parts of component in project. For me, JS give me possibilities to change the outlook of Web, even available me make interaction for user and supply dynamic visual.</p><h3 id="nodeBox"><a href="#nodeBox" class="headerlink" title="nodeBox"></a>nodeBox</h3><p>NodeBox is a powerful tool to create dynamic graphic. It have a GUI face, so we can edit data with clear, simple way. In this work, I tried to use variable as ratio of shape, that means every shape would be created with a random way, but it keep a dynamic ratio, so it shows a motion of graphic.</p><img src="/2018/10/22/Think-about-Variable-in-art-creation/photo1.gif"><p>In this picture, these square are created with a dynamic ratio, the ratio was set as a Sin function, the value changed with frames. As we know, the min value of Sin() is <strong>-1</strong>， the max one is <strong>1</strong>, so the value will be a loop. <del>我爱数学数学爱我(no)</del><br>The interesting thing is, if I change even really small value of variable, it will make totally different visual language. </p><img src="/2018/10/22/Think-about-Variable-in-art-creation/photo2.gif"><h3 id="NodeBox-PS-AE"><a href="#NodeBox-PS-AE" class="headerlink" title="NodeBox + PS/AE"></a>NodeBox + PS/AE</h3><p>Nodebox can create random shape easily, it support the dynamic shape and variable can be changed. Furthermore, the shape can be rendered as frames, so they can be used as video. I created motion graphic in NodeBox, and translate to GIF image by PS. PS can quickly adjust layout and colours of elements, so it is possible to make digital poster by variable and motion graphic.</p><img src="/2018/10/22/Think-about-Variable-in-art-creation/photo3.gif"><h2 id="The-value-of-variable-for-a-design"><a href="#The-value-of-variable-for-a-design" class="headerlink" title="The value of variable for a design"></a>The value of variable for a design</h2><p>It’s no debt that it is difficult to control a variable, but it indeed support more possibilities for artist. Firstly, a dynamic design have more style, which can give <strong>unpredictable effect</strong>; Secondly, variable generally available user to interact with elements or interface, and visual could change when user give different operation, so it support interesting <strong>interactive</strong> experience; Thirdly, flexible variable can suit custom of user, such as change layout base on user’s <strong>devices, location, time and language</strong>. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="How-designer-does-research"><a href="#How-designer-does-research" class="headerlink" title="How designer does research"></a>How designer does research</h1><p>Whatever innovation must not be create from nothing, it must be developed or conducted by many basic theories or idea. Creation could <strong>constructed by original things</strong>, the important thing is to get <strong>existed thing</strong> to built new up. <a id="more"></a> Therefore, it is vital to do research for a designer. Research is a way to find new idea, though it might be created by others, but as designer, we can translate the idea to own. Furthermore, it is necessary to collect evidence and theories to prove own work.</p><h2 id="Research-can-be-enjoyable"><a href="#Research-can-be-enjoyable" class="headerlink" title="Research can be enjoyable"></a>Research can be enjoyable</h2><p>In research seminar, two designers showed their idea about research and method to achieve a good development of work. But the important thing for me is, how to keep a positive attitude to do research, which means we should <strong>enjoy</strong> the process of research rather then complete an assignment. </p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/fiona_grady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiona</a> said,</p><blockquote><p>the research in social media can improve the confidence of artists because they can get constructive feedback and gain more friends which have same interests.</p></blockquote><p>For me, do research on social media could not be a good idea because I generally be attracted by other things. The point I absolutely agree is that we should gain confidence and pleasure in the process of research. It might improve my <strong>ambition</strong> to realise new things or accept something I hadn’t agreed or understood. </p><h2 id="how-do-we-do-research-in-a-happy-experience"><a href="#how-do-we-do-research-in-a-happy-experience" class="headerlink" title="how do we do research in a happy experience?"></a>how do we do research in a happy experience?</h2><p>It’s no doubt that people always glad to do something might make self <strong>happy </strong>. To make self be happy, we should focus on something we interested. Unfortunately, sometimes the topic of subject could not the favourite one, even some theories are serious and boring. <em>how can we change the attitude and be more excited in process of research?</em>  In my view, the key is <strong>synchronise with experiment</strong>. That’s means, when we are doing  research, we should do some experiments and sketch or mind-map, so we can see the process of our thinking and understanding, we might get clear understanding, and it the <strong>result or outcome</strong> could make us be more confident, rather then a dozen of paper, so boring, isn’t it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Research-about-Manfred-Mohr"><a href="#Research-about-Manfred-Mohr" class="headerlink" title="Research about Manfred Mohr"></a>Research about Manfred Mohr</h1><p>Manfred Mohr is a pioneer of digital art. I saw his work in V&amp;A museum. His attitude for computer generated art is convincing and similar with me.<br><a id="more"></a></p><p>As he said,</p><blockquote><p>I write computer algorithms i.e. rules that calculate and then generate the work which could not be realized in any other way. My artistic goal is reached when a finished work can dissociate itself from its logical content and stand convincingly as an independent abstract entity.</p></blockquote><p>Data and algorithms could be visualize, and computer can operate thousands of programmer to render the image that definitely hard to draw by hand. In addition, Mohr thought about the deeper form of digital art. His algorithms can render shape by particular way and <strong>create</strong> new composition of shape which means every elements exist in work could be different in composition and any other details. <strong>LOOKS COMPUTER COULD BE THINKING</strong>. Actually computer can’t thinking now, it merely doing something that have been set, but it can control variable to make every elements have tiny differences.</p><h2 id="Early-work"><a href="#Early-work" class="headerlink" title="Early work"></a>Early work</h2><blockquote><p>My early artistic work was influenced by <strong>atonal music</strong>, modern Jazz and <strong>abstract expressionism</strong>. As a consequence, geometry and the reduction of my visual vocabulary to black and white as binary decisions, took more and more importance in my work after 1963. </p></blockquote><p>As he said, he was inspired by atonal music and expressionism. It is really interesting, for me, music and expressionism both are emotional and abstract objects which are hard to describe by words or logical. But Mohr expressed these objects by computer, which have strict ruler and grammar in programmer. So, there is strong contrast in his work, because <strong>he used rational object convert to abstract information</strong>.</p><p>Here are some early test of work and experiment of him:</p><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo1.jpg"><ul><li>(Photo1) In this work, I can find his intention of express music and <strong>atone</strong>. To convey the unregulated and unordered tone, he drew some crooked border lines to represent tone in stave. I can guess it could the reason he used computer to draw random objects. In his drawing, I can see the difficulty of drawing absolutely random things, <strong>at most time we draw something with the order of brain, and the order generally is informative and conceive</strong>. </li></ul><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo2.jpg"><ul><li><p>(Photo2) This work showed a construction of lines. A nylon stocking is tear up and put on board. It shows different density of lines and negative space. To control the density of order, repeat and innocence thing can convey specific information.</p></li><li><p>In 1969-1972, Mohr began to design algorithms to express his work. Image was printed by <strong>plotter</strong> which can be controlled by algorithm. </p></li></ul><blockquote><p>A number of printer control languages were created to operate pen plotters, and transmit commands like “lift pen from paper”, “place pen on paper”, or “draw a line from here to here”. Three common ASCII-based plotter control languages are Hewlett-Packard’s HP-GL, its successor HP-GL/2 and Houston Instruments DMPL. Here is a simple HP-GL script drawing a line :</p></blockquote><pre><code>SP1;PA500,500;PD;PR0,1000;PU;SP;</code></pre><blockquote><p>This program instructs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plotter</a>, in order, to take the first pen (SP1 = Select Pen 1), to go to coordinates X=500, Y=500 on the paper sheet (PA = Plot Absolute), to lower the pen against the paper (PD = Pen Down), to move 1000 units in the Y direction (thus drawing a vertical line - PR = Plot Relative), to lift the pen (PU = Pen Up) and finally to put it back in its stall.</p></blockquote><p>As we can see, early plotter has strict ruler and logical grammar. It should be given some order and parameter to draw image. </p><p><strong>data and parameter could convert to informative shape</strong>,<br><strong><em>can shape or words return to data? So it might be reconstructed and convey new means?</em></strong></p><p>In this idea, Chinese word could be dissociated to different stroke, pronunciation, stress and <strong>component</strong> which group up a word. In Chinese word, there are <strong>4 stresses</strong> in pronunciation ruler, and most of character components (PianPang) have specific meanings, thats means, a Chinese word can <strong>be separated to be different words and meaning</strong>. Though it will <strong>lose the accuracy expression</strong>, it still convey part of original meaning and excess meaning. In later day, I would do deeper research about separation of Chinese character.</p><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo3.png"><ul><li>(photo3) This work is made from vertical and horizon line, the horizon one is thicker so we can clear see that continuous line changed the direction. Actually the trace of line is <strong>random</strong> and controlled by algorithms. <em>how long it go straight, how it change direction, when?</em> The algorithms operate plotter to draw this image. It could be really interesting if we printed hundreds of it, the random walk of line, like a creature, smart and fool. </li></ul><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo4.gif"><ul><li>(photo4) Random and variable can make complex composition, there are infinitive possibilities can be render, but the ruler is not changed, and the visual grammar is both same. In this point, the shape merely as a outcome, <strong>the algorithms could be art finally</strong>. <em>A designer do not just create shape, it support a ruler, a model, a code</em>.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The elements are horizontal, vertical, 45 degree lines, square waves, zig-zags, and have probabilities for line widths and lengths.<br>In each position on a very dense imaginary matrix, a sign is composed from 0-7 elements from the above alphabet.<br>When 0 lines are chosen, a circle can be drawn having a randomly chosen radius and center.</p></blockquote><p>An image system in film could be made from similar elements, such as shape, structure and colours. These things combine with each other in an obscure (not obvious) way, but it indeed support a feeling or <strong>key</strong> that make all of elements connected. In addition, it makes association, because its <em>ruler, grammar, way of composition</em>. <a href="https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/film-technique-how-a-master-uses-image-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using of image system in film factory</a></p><p><strong>Similar with image system, a computer-generated image could be made from series of elements which could be really simple, they group up with specific layout, and changed size or width, etc..</strong></p>]]></content>

Though I contacted screen printing before, heres tutor gave us many useful information.<br><a id="more"></a></p><h2 id="Steps-to-print"><a href="#Steps-to-print" class="headerlink" title="Steps to print"></a>Steps to print</h2><ul><li><p>The first step is clear the table and prepare a <strong>laysheet</strong>. That’s the paper we would print as outcome. And we must bring <strong>original work</strong>. We should place the original work to comfirm the position we print on laysheet. So we paste work (it generally is acid paper) Fixed by tape. Than we fix film board on print machine so it hard to move. A little tip is fold a paper and paste on laysheet, so it is available to move and adjust to a right position though the sheet will be covered by film board.</p></li><li><p>The ink should be adjust to be wet and smooth that’s means it will not dry too quick. To confect (调制) a good quality ink, we should balance the ratio of <strong>acrylic medium</strong> and <strong>acrylic</strong>. Medium should be put into container at first, because it can available acrylic mixed completely. <strong>50%</strong> medium and about 10g acrylic, and tiny other colours if we nee d mixed colour. <del>其实就挤三四陀就好了。</del> </p></li><li><p>To print well, we should print ink equality, <strong>DO NOT</strong> print overly, it lose all of details of engraving. The most important thing is that if we print a multicolour work, the position of laysheet should be accuracy place. We use first work that took mark with laystops to  guarantee that. </p></li></ul><h2 id="Why-use-screen-printing"><a href="#Why-use-screen-printing" class="headerlink" title="Why use screen printing?"></a>Why use screen printing?</h2><p>Screen printing is a technique that print something have original details. Though it could print repeatedly, every times printing with different speeds or force might make different effect. </p><p>Furthermore, the making of film board could be hand drawn that’s means some hand drawn illustrations can be use as film, and print to different colors. Different with digital creation, the process of making film could have tiny differences between original painting, so it will full of unpredictable details that really gorgeous for me.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-arts-of-science"><a href="#The-arts-of-science" class="headerlink" title="The arts of science"></a>The arts of science</h2><p>We are both rely on technology and smart devices today, and digital art or digital media have been really popluar in public sight. As designers, we generally use computer everyday, it is hard to imagine that how can I work when I leave computer.<a id="more"></a>  Did computer really support us to make incredible work? Is it <strong>REALLY VITAL THING</strong> in creation process? Or we merely rely on convient drawing or storage? It could make sence to understand early computer work and relieze how early computer artists thinking about art.</p><p>In the early computer generated work, most of work could be made by mathematician or scientists, because they should operate complex progremmer on computer. Sometimes they did works with random shape or regular form, which could not be defined to an art work. If we focus on their process of working, we can find that they are trying to make computer to create something that generally repeat and change with some variable.</p><img src="/2018/10/12/V-A-Classical-digital-work/photo.jpg"><p>As Manfred <strong>Mohr said</strong>, </p><blockquote><p>it is more important that develop a priori vocabulary which integrates the computer into the aesthethic system.</p></blockquote><p>As a tool, computer can make really fine image with actually a easy way. The more difficult thing is that how can we make computer create image as a <strong>CREATOR</strong>? That’s means computer should have the ability to create image that does’t create by hand. In fact, computer would ever create something from <strong>ZERO</strong>. It must opearte with some programmer that set by artist. In Manfred’s work, I saw some shape grouped with some specific method. These shape will be no sense if anyone out from group, and if they set in a matrix, we can see the visual grammer of work. Artist set a way that computer can create polyline and circle, and the quantity of point or length of line could be <strong>random</strong>, so every shape will have tiny differents but shows amazing variety.</p><img src="/2018/10/12/V-A-Classical-digital-work/photo2.jpg"><p>In this work, letters are printed as a strict format, like frame in frame. Computer always render some info from data bank by specific method, and the exsit of data could be visualization. Analyze the attribute or quantity of data, and render to more clear visual information. For illustration, artist could use tiny elements to make a bigger group, we collect different essential elements to imitate some situation and environment.</p><img src="/2018/10/12/V-A-Classical-digital-work/photo3.jpg">]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discuss-with-research"><a href="#Discuss-with-research" class="headerlink" title="Discuss with research"></a>Discuss with research</h2><p>As an academic skill, research is the vital thing in my study process. In the begin of term, critical thinking and research have been the most important subject. Indeed, research for me was really helpful in the past projects.<br><a id="more"></a><br>I collected others’ ideas and method to seek possibilities in my own work. Evenmore, research could be a tool that understand others’ opion or attitude. That’s means, a work developed by research, it might be more acceptable, because some parts of it were inspired from existent theories and knowledges.</p><p>One of classmates do research by experience and travel real location to feel atmosphere. It would be more sensetive if we go somewhere and observe local objects. Not only take photos, but find out some details in building, environment and human culture. If we want to realize somewhere, it is a good way to stay there, merely do nothing. In my view, doing research not just take notes or sketch something, keeping thinking and being relax could be useful to inspired self.</p><p>Another classmates said a question that always confused me that sometimes we usually don’t know <strong>WHY</strong> did we choose some colours in our work. Sometimes, we indeed like do somtings we would like to do, which without reasons. Evenmore, we found more evidence to demonstrate that. Although it could be a way to develop work, it is still not reasonable. As a designer, we should know the reason we choose some layout or colours, it can be logical and linear. So it is important to draft our project, when we have some satisfied scheme, <em>we should do more research and realize why it is good</em>, so we will get more clear mind to develop that. 🌚</p><p>Finally, somebody showed her FMP for us. They are some engraving works with gorgeous texture. And she pointed some special texture was created by <strong>ACCIDENT</strong> which made because of something broken. Fortunately, this accident made a really good shape with powerful trace. Charley said, </p><blockquote><p>we call it <strong>LUCKY ACCIDENT</strong> </p></blockquote><p>😂😂😂 Is it means art need luck? Of course <strong>NO!</strong> The lucky girl said, she used some bad outcome which printed with unsatisfied texture, she developed by cut and refine the outline. She distinguished the quality of work, and did action research, so she could create better work than early one. <strong><em>Face own lose, find the reason than refine that</em></strong> Maybe reason could be the most important thing when we creating work, and research can help us to define the reason we choose.</p><p>Cheers.</p>]]></content>

At first, I cant believe that there are both digital work when I saw the date of creation. I said,</p><blockquote><p>it looks like a digital work!</p></blockquote><p>Of course they are, they definitely are, and they are the pioneer of digital arts! Cool!</p><img src="/2018/10/09/First-day-in-V-A/IMG_6763.JPG"><p>As Colette saids,</p><blockquote><p>“Grass is random and random is a natural computer facility. Computer grass is natural grass”(1980)</p></blockquote><p>Computer is really good at doing something random and repeat . It can do some thing repeatedly during hundred of thousand times, so something complex can be produce which could be a nightmare if did by someone. Random is beautiful, especially something changed with some regular. Something might be interesting because of tiny differences, that’s why some illustrators fall into creating some texture or brush-stroke. Some random variable can be set in computer and used to create delicate shape with thousands of possibilities.</p><p>Next time, I might create some work about variable. As a future illustrator, I should use these variable or shape to convey some specific information. Popularity? Geography? Traffic? Whatever they are, a contemporary illustration work should support clearer meaning. Advanced animation technic and colours display could be my good tool to use.</p><p>Cheers, for ancient computer and pioneers of digital arts.!</p>]]></content>
