For example, the walkway in the shape of a square of the transept floor in a church or the polygonal or circular form of a roof that results in a dome. The interest of a space in transition is how it changes from one form to another.</p></blockquote><hr><p><img src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/55a5/2b20/e58e/ce02/2900/0020/slideshow/figura_28.jpg?1436887838" alt="alt"></p><blockquote><p>In Strangers on a Train, there is another theme that we don’t want to leave out: the magnetism of architecture and its direct relation with the notion of suspense. The film is shot in Washington, a monumental city of great hubs and plazas. It’s revealing to observe how in the movie the confrontation between two men (Guy and Bruno), is always obstructed by architecture. The monument has the burden of staging and of being the magnetic force that adds suspense to the whole scene. The architecture in this case acts an analogy of the domination Bruno exerts over Guy.</p></blockquote><p>Also present in all of Hitchcock’s movies is the mysterious relationship between central and periphery. That is, the relationship between small and large scale, where small objects take on different connotations after being immersed in a metropolitan context.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Generate-bitmap-by-Text"><a href="#Generate-bitmap-by-Text" class="headerlink" title="Generate bitmap by Text"></a>Generate bitmap by Text</h1><p>Bitmap is the image combined by individual <strong>pixel</strong>. To reproduce a bitmap, we can analyze each <strong>value of pixel</strong>. Which means we should get the color of this pixel, when we generate new pixel / graphic, we can use these data, so the new image will looks like the original one.</p><hr><p>位图是由像素组成的,为了重绘一个位图,我们要分析每一个像素的数据比如颜色和位置. 当得到那些数据后,在绘制的时候,就能把相对应的数据带入新的像素(这可能是由字符或者别的图形组成的), 这样的新图片看起来就会和原来的图片很像.</p><h2 id="Environment"><a href="#Environment" class="headerlink" title="Environment"></a>Environment</h2><p>In this workshop, I’m going to use HTML and Javascript to build the drawing programme. To control <strong>Canvas</strong> in HTML5, I used <strong>CreateJS</strong> to draw and set graphic, which eaiser than original Web canvas API.</p><h2 id="Get-pixel-data"><a href="#Get-pixel-data" class="headerlink" title="Get pixel data"></a>Get pixel data</h2><p>Firstly, we should create <strong>image</strong> then add it in <strong>context</strong> of canvas.</p><pre><code>let ctx = document.getElementByID(&#39;canvas ID&#39;).getContext(&#39;2d&#39;)let img = new Image()img.src = &#39;img/xxx.jpg&#39;ctx.drawImg(img,0,0)</code></pre><p>So far, we’ve draw the image on canvas, so we can call <strong>getImageData</strong> to build a object which save data of pixel in memory.</p><pre><code>let imgDt = ctx.getImageData(0,0,img.width,img.height)// chose a range of area, same as image&#39;s size</code></pre><h2 id="draw-pixel-one-by-one"><a href="#draw-pixel-one-by-one" class="headerlink" title="draw pixel one by one"></a>draw pixel one by one</h2><p>Before we use these data to draw, we should relize what’s it. <strong>getImageData()</strong> built a <em>ImageData</em> object, this object has a <strong>data</strong> attribute, and all of pixel data have saved in there as a <strong>Uint8ClampedArray</strong>, which only save the number in [0-255]. And our pixel will be analyze the color as <strong>RGBA</strong>. So each pixel will add a number in this Array.</p><p>These a article I read, it analyzed the regular of Array<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/12/faster-canvas-pixel-manipulation-with-typed-arrays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a></p><p>other <a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/html5-canvas/pixels.html#manipulating-the-pixels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a></p><p>For draw pixel at X and Y axis, we should use two For() loop to create graphic in 2D.</p><pre><code>for(let v=0;v&lt;img.width;v++){    for(let row=0;row&lt;img.height;row++){        // these two for loop can iterate each pixel        // key point is to get index from IMGdata        let index = [v*img.width + row]*4        imgDt[index] //color R        imgDt[index+1 ] //color G        imgDt[index+2 ] //color B        imgDt[index+3 ] //color A, influence size        // there&#39;re all of pixel data        let dot = new createjs.Shape()        dot.graphics.beginFill(RGB).drawCircle(0,0,size)        Stage.addchild(dot)    }}Stage.update()</code></pre><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/03/13/5c891cac51e33.png" alt="alt"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/03/13/5c891cac9be24.png" alt="alt"></p><h2 id="Source-of-text"><a href="#Source-of-text" class="headerlink" title="Source of text"></a>Source of text</h2><p>To get some interesing text, I used <strong>Google could document</strong>, which support user type text by voice.

Who is the audience? What kind of people have the ability to read? It is a <strong>scope of art</strong>. Which means, this <strong>thing</strong> in these crowds, would be seen as art, and in others people’s opinion, it could be nothing even a rubbish. So when we talk about an art, or discuss is it an art, shall we think about the <strong>context</strong> of creation, reason of creation.</p><h2 id="Art-without-audience"><a href="#Art-without-audience" class="headerlink" title="Art without audience"></a>Art without audience</h2><p>If an art which doesn’t need any audience, the artist do the work only for self, it show his <strong>own</strong> feeling, emotion, is it an <strong>Art</strong>? If you understand the meaning of that, or you appreciate the visuals of that, you think it is a art; if not, that is not art for you. So for an art, a personal art, the value not be defined as how much people understand that, is could be <em>how it shows author’s idea</em>.</p><h2 id="Are-art-works-as-common-goods"><a href="#Are-art-works-as-common-goods" class="headerlink" title="Are art works as common goods"></a>Are art works as common goods</h2><p>We know arts can take commercial profit for artist, even Van Gogh sold his work for survive as well.

Because Javascript’s <strong>Array</strong> is not real array, so we use <strong>强类型</strong> array to save data.</p><pre><code>let arr = new Float32Array([1,2,3])</code></pre><p>This piece of code create a 浮点数 array, which can quickly use.</p><h3 id="load-own-3D-object"><a href="#load-own-3D-object" class="headerlink" title="load own 3D object"></a>load own 3D object</h3><p>ThreeJS allow user load own object. <strong>Blender 2.8</strong> can export usable object as GLTF, we should reference a script to use a GLTF loader. Then implement a <em>GLTFLoader class</em>:</p><pre><code>let loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();loader.load(    &quot;js/myObject.glb&quot;,    function(gltf){        let scene = gltf.scene // it&#39;s a scece        let model = scene.children // there would be a Array, all of object in there        s.add(model) // s is our global variable    },    function(xhr){        console.log( ( xhr.loaded / xhr.total * 100 ) + &#39;% loaded&#39; ); //异步操作    })</code></pre><p>Another thing we should note is, the model could be really large, or far away global center, <em>so our camera would not shot that, so it will not appear </em>. The solution is, move it to global center. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Blogging"><a href="#Blogging" class="headerlink" title="Blogging!"></a>Blogging!</h1><p>This blog began from Oct 2018, which is the time I started my MA course. At early stage, I used blog to record some experiment and notes on seminar. It is a good way to save and share ideas <del>though nobody ever came here😢😢</del>, it is still a good place I can record my academic life. furthermore, I develop my Blog by <strong>Hexo</strong> framework, so I learn much knowledge about Web development. And I’m developing more function and style by myself, which real good for my coding ability and career. Let’s talk about more about my Blog construction, function, and future expectation.</p><h2 id="Categories"><a href="#Categories" class="headerlink" title="Categories"></a>Categories</h2><p><strong>Category</strong> is important to sort post. I used different Caties(categories) to define different function of articles / posts. different caties have individual style and layout, and they have differnt content on <strong>index</strong>, which support clear information to audience or myself.</p><h3 id="Journal"><a href="#Journal" class="headerlink" title="Journal"></a>Journal</h3><p>This is the essential of blog, most post were defined as <em>Journal</em>, which carry general content, such as <strong>note, ideas, experiment, anything else</strong>. It could not be academic, and sometime will be post images. So, the layout on index can be divided as two style, <em>preview content</em>&amp; <em>image and abstract</em>.</p><h3 id="gallery"><a href="#gallery" class="headerlink" title="gallery"></a>gallery</h3><p>This is a important class for a visual artist. It shows preview image on index for direct visual expression. Furthermore, the image can be clicked as new block, user can click button to change and scan image of a post. It basically is used to post my <strong>outcome or visual experiment</strong>. </p><p>As the increasement of image, I found I might need more style to show differnt kinds of image, such as <strong>drawing, photography, vector graphic, motion graphic, video</strong>. They are definitely differnt, when I exhibit them, should I use differnt <strong>size / resolution</strong> ? Maybe. So I add some options in module programme, when code checked differnt type, it generate relateive layout.</p><h3 id="research"><a href="#research" class="headerlink" title="research"></a>research</h3><p>As digital artist, I would like do research on computer, as well as experiment, so most recording and research article are saved on computer. Then I create this cat as my <strong>sketchbook</strong>, all of <strong>file or text / image</strong> can saved and post on <em>research</em> cat, so peers and tutor can easily relize what Im doing. Because it could be simple or short, sometimes massive text from copy and reference, so I decided to use <strong>Tag</strong> to abstract content of post as <em>research cat</em>. Which means, index only show <strong>tag</strong> of this kind of post, I and others can click tag to gain more relatvie information from same tag of post. It is a good way to expand idea <strong>horizontally</strong>.</p><h3 id="reflection"><a href="#reflection" class="headerlink" title="reflection"></a>reflection</h3><p>Reflection will be academic when I post that. In future, I will add <strong>Grammaly</strong> or <strong>Translate API</strong> to help different language user to understand my article. On index, <em>reflection block</em> will show <strong>preview content</strong> and <strong>catelog and content guide</strong>, which means, audience can click a interesting <strong>Part / heading</strong> of content, and he will go to the sepcific postion of this post. By this way, audience could quickly understand <strong>what I’ve done, what steps I used, thinking process</strong>. </p><h2 id="Other-expectation"><a href="#Other-expectation" class="headerlink" title="Other expectation"></a>Other expectation</h2><p>I’m going to develop a new cat which can collect <strong>ideas</strong>. Sometimes I used <em>journal</em> to record idea, but idea could be really <em>short and shuffle</em>, it can not be a <em>article</em>, and it will be burden(累赘) for index, if too many short post are displayed on index. That’s the reason I want to build a <em>idea Page</em>, in this page, all of <em>idea</em> will be grouped and showed, with <strong>relative tag</strong>, is it sounds really cool? I can shuffle these <em>ideas</em> and randomly scan them when I want to find inspiration. Maybe I can add some function to allow user select some words, and programme will use google search, and find some <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> research.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Confirm a style in animated illustration</title>
      <link href="/2019/02/20/confirm-a-style-in-animated-illustration/"/>
      <url>/2019/02/20/confirm-a-style-in-animated-illustration/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Reflection-the-feasibility-of-interactive-illustration"><a href="#Reflection-the-feasibility-of-interactive-illustration" class="headerlink" title="Reflection: the feasibility of interactive illustration"></a>Reflection: the feasibility of interactive illustration</h1><h2 id="What-we-did"><a href="#What-we-did" class="headerlink" title="What we did"></a>What we did</h2><p>Last week, I and my collaborator completed the script of this project. As the first target we confirmed, we will do a project with narrative expression. Which means, we want to talk about a <strong>story</strong>. </p><p>The context of story had been confirmed, <strong>Technology and love</strong>, as well as the content of story, <em>the effect of technology to people and thier love</em>, story can be separate as 3 chapters:</p><ol><li>they met</li><li>they are in love</li><li>they argued</li><li>future</li></ol><p>We r going to show different communicate method in different period which be effected by techonology. In deeper meanning, we want to show the different communication methods. Communication can be seen as <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>psychological</strong>. When human develop their technology, and communicatino method, they could trend to communicate with <strong>physicals</strong>. For example, people seek speed and accuracy in communication, but forget the abstract / emotion expression.</p><p>In this project, the abstraction expression could not be showed. We show shortage of physical communciation, we show affect of rubbish infomation.</p><h2 id="evaluate"><a href="#evaluate" class="headerlink" title="evaluate"></a>evaluate</h2><p>Do we successful in this stage? How good we did? To be honest, it is not complete good.</p><p>Something good:</p><ol><li>I and my collaborate confirmed a good topic, which suit our common habbit and specialist field</li><li>we complete a edited / coherence storyboard </li><li>Our story have a steady point to express</li></ol><p>something bad:</p><ol><li>We have not confirmed the final format or work!</li><li>We have not confirmed style of artistic</li><li>20 days left only 😅</li></ol><h3 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h3><p>At early stage we want to combine Web and animation with a interactive way. Which means, audience can control / effect some elements when it motion. The question is, <strong>level / degree</strong> of control, <strong>how much</strong> user can move this elemnts, <em>does it will be paused when user control it?</em>, <em>can user change the frame?</em>, <em>it is animation or PPT-style Web?</em>.</p><p>We are be <em>limited by technic</em>, therefore, this work could be become techinic-trend, that’s means the narractive / expression would be effected / limited by exist techinic, that’s not cool. </p><h3 id="How"><a href="#How" class="headerlink" title="How"></a>How</h3><p>To solove this problem, we should understand what we want to say, and which way could be the suitest one. So, I list the specialist of different technic:</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:left">format / attribute</th><th style="text-align:left">coherence</th><th style="text-align:left">flexibility</th><th style="text-align:left">interactivity</th><th style="text-align:left">reusability</th><th style="text-align:left">difficulty</th><th style="text-align:left">stylistic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:left">animation-autoPlay</td><td style="text-align:left">very good, even with rhythm</td><td style="text-align:left">can add color Filter</td><td style="text-align:left">No</td><td style="text-align:left">can be added on 3D model</td><td style="text-align:left">rhythm control</td><td style="text-align:left">vector rely, weak pixel motion</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left">PPT-like animation</td><td style="text-align:left">weak, stop animation</td><td style="text-align:left">high randomness</td><td style="text-align:left">speed of read</td><td style="text-align:left">image reusable</td><td style="text-align:left">low</td><td style="text-align:left">complexed allowed</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:left">game-like animation</td><td style="text-align:left">very weak even can’t play</td><td style="text-align:left">ex, choose-base visuals</td><td style="text-align:left">ex, user effect narrative</td><td style="text-align:left">low</td><td style="text-align:left">programme-base</td><td style="text-align:left">vector mainly</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After I listed these advantages and disadvantages of different format, I thought, <em>I can choose different method to express different range / chapter of story</em>. </p><p>Before I combine / choose a format, it is good to experiment at first, so next step I could make some samples, and we will discuss more about the effect of communication, and <strong>can different methods represent different technologies?</strong></p><h2 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h2><p>In this progress, I knew the importance of a steady target of expression, which means, when we doing a project and we have many different option of idea / methodologies, we should choose one with our requirement or expression, <em>the method can express the idea</em>.</p><p>So, in future work, before option choosing, I will conclude the difference of methods, and their advantages / disadvantages. If I have enough time, try it, then give answer, else list them, analyze them.</p>]]></content>

These children may have come from a previous relationship or through other opportunities such as adoption, artificial insemination, or surrogacy. In the year to 31 March 2016, same-sex couples in the U.K. adopted 450 children, or 9.6 per cent of the total number of children adopted in that year. Most researchers in the field agree that children raised by one or two gay or lesbian parents suffer no particular disadvantage. </p></blockquote><p>Same-sex family are becoming more common, and the homosexual have became more acceptable in more countries, somewhere even allow homosexual marriage. Will it change the tranditional family construction?</p><blockquote><p>In the end, the cereal packet family contained the seed of its own destruction. Today more than ever, people are chasing romance and, in the process, creating instability. High divorce rates over the years have led to a considerable number of lone parents and reconstituted families. Assisted by rising life expectancies, economic and social forces are shifting responsibility back onto the extended family, and, at the same time helping to ease an epidemic of loneliness among the elderly. Younger people are choosing cohabitation over marriage, and it is possible to envisage a looser form of cohabitation overtaking marriage, along with a more serial or task-driven approach to partnering over the course of a lengthening lifespan. The relation between man and woman is increasingly one of equals, although it is very apparent from lone parent families in particular that women are still doing the bulk of the childrearing. More and more people are choosing a childfree life, or having children outside of a more traditional arrangement, and both these trends seem set to continue. It is still early days for same-sex relationships, which may grow more common as gender and sexuality become more fluid and relationships less beholden to old stereotypes and an imperative for procreation.</p></blockquote><p>Contemporary marriage could have became more flexible and free, people might want have more private time or space, somebody even give up marriage, they chose live together but not in law.</p><h2 id="Family-and-population"><a href="#Family-and-population" class="headerlink" title="Family and population"></a>Family and population</h2><p>From: <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/05/what-will-the-family-of-the-future-look-like/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What will the family of the future look like?</a></p><blockquote><p>Childbearing is higher in countries with higher levels of female labour force participation, economic development, generosity of paid parental leave provision for mothers and paternity leave.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://assets.weforum.org/editor/wzJSNduErX3CgoCyqM_lSuu_LZ_3weiLOp84Xm7z720.jpg" alt="chart"></p><blockquote><p>However, look at the chart above and you can see that in all countries women still devote more time than men in housework activities.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Technology-and-communication"><a href="#Technology-and-communication" class="headerlink" title="Technology and communication"></a>Technology and communication</h1><p>During the collaboration, we thought about how technology changed human’s method of communication. Different to other creature, human-being have strong relationship in <strong>group and society</strong>, because of the effective communication. <a id="more"></a></p><h2 id="What-improve-the-communication"><a href="#What-improve-the-communication" class="headerlink" title="What improve the communication?"></a>What improve the communication?</h2><ul><li>Painting / image</li><li>Language / character</li><li>Paper / Printing</li><li>Telegraph / telephone</li><li>Radio / TV / Fax</li><li>Mobile phone</li><li>Internet / WIFI</li><li>AR / VR</li></ul><p>There’s the history of development of communication, people used more advanced tech to improve the efficiency of communication, <em>speed, distance, accuracy</em>.</p><h2 id="the-form-of-communication"><a href="#the-form-of-communication" class="headerlink" title="the form of communication"></a>the form of communication</h2><p>Communication can be defined as physical and psychological, object or subject. Whatever any technologies we used on communication, that would be express our content. </p><p>To narrative or record someting in the past, could be hard. People used painting to describe a action, method, story, object; they invented language to talk with each other; they wrote by characters, but original technology limited these methods, bad container, bearer, low efficiency, so people were inventing new technology to communnicate.</p><h2 id="content-of-communication"><a href="#content-of-communication" class="headerlink" title="content of communication"></a>content of communication</h2><p>Methods are changing, ever. But the content people communicated would not be changed, in sometimes. People talk, discuss, express. All of people have family, everyone will fall in love, they expressed thier love, emotion.</p><h3 id="Family-and-love"><a href="#Family-and-love" class="headerlink" title="Family and love"></a>Family and love</h3><p><strong>Family, love</strong> could be the eternal topic in human society, because creature need <strong>multiply</strong>, people generate children, and hold a group, as a family.</p><h3 id="War"><a href="#War" class="headerlink" title="War"></a>War</h3><p><strong>War</strong> is horrible, but unfortunately, we are hard to doubt that, war can be remove. Indeed, human have joined war million years, never stopped. Even the technology is developed to serve the war. So, in content of communication, war is the topic can’t be remove.</p><h2 id="relationship-between-Love-amp-War"><a href="#relationship-between-Love-amp-War" class="headerlink" title="relationship between Love &amp; War"></a>relationship between Love &amp; War</h2><p>It looks ironical, love and war can be seen as two contrast symbols, love represent life, and war is death. Life and death, is the eternal circle in world. So they are opposite things.</p><h3 id="Would-war-ever-exist-in-future"><a href="#Would-war-ever-exist-in-future" class="headerlink" title="Would war ever exist in future?"></a>Would war ever exist in future?</h3><p>This question is impossible to answer now, but I will do more research at this point. </p><p>Now, I can only guess, that war would not disappear. Maybe we will stop war on the Earth, but war will not stop in universe. (hahah, this is not a fiction novel).</p><p>Why? In my view, multiply is a thing which affect others and profit self. Generation will use resource, and the gerneration is infinite, resource is limited, there is necessary conflict on division of resource. So conflict will not disappear, as well as war.</p><h1 id="About-collaborative-project"><a href="#About-collaborative-project" class="headerlink" title="About collaborative project"></a>About collaborative project</h1><p>As we planned, the outcome would be a Web aniamted illustration. The main topic will relate Tech &amp; communication, and the content of communication, would be relate <strong>love and war</strong>, or only <strong>love</strong>, it depend on time we have.</p><h2 id="Style"><a href="#Style" class="headerlink" title="Style"></a>Style</h2><p>In early expectation, this work should show our ability at image making and editing. Therefore each piece of picture would be <em>coherence and narrative</em>.</p><h3 id="constract-on-editing"><a href="#constract-on-editing" class="headerlink" title="constract on editing"></a>constract on editing</h3><p>We might use image about <em>love</em> and <em>war</em> like interlock,so each frame could make strong constrast <strong>on mind</strong>, and we might use constract on <strong>colours</strong>, like <strong>Complementary colour</strong> or <strong>colour tone &amp; grey tone</strong> even <strong>Black &amp; White</strong> .</p><h3 id="parallism-editing"><a href="#parallism-editing" class="headerlink" title="parallism editing"></a>parallism editing</h3><p>I mentioned that, the content of communciation would not change,( <em>love and war</em>) so we might use same content in differnet <strong>space or time</strong>, with different technology or method of communication. Cool.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Play-with-computer"><a href="#Play-with-computer" class="headerlink" title="Play with computer"></a>Play with computer</h1><p>Is computer fool? No, you saw Alpha Go, you saw the super calculator. But I say, computer is still a <strong>tool</strong> <del>fool</del> right now. It rely on your order / operation, <del>sometimes even doesn’t work though</del>. Well, let’s talk about some function it took me and the reason I thought it is a fool, then I will show some methods to deal with computer.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Painting-with-computer"><a href="#Painting-with-computer" class="headerlink" title="Painting with computer"></a>Painting with computer</h2><p>As a designer, computer supported sorts of methods to draw, whatever vector graphic, bitmap,or motional graphic. For painting, CG <a href="ComputerGraphic">^1</a> can imitate real textrue or materials even stroke / brush and press. </p><p>Basically, CG can be defined <strong>Shaded &amp; Flat</strong> (厚涂,平涂)for me. Shaded painting means artist will shade the graphic to make it looks more like <strong>real</strong>, object’s volume / 3D can be described as a objective effect. <strong>Flat painting</strong> have become more popluar than 10 years ago, this style gernerally use <em>solid</em> color and <em>flat</em> shape. Sometimes it’s abstract but has stronger visuals. Furthermore, in Japanese animation field, flat colours are filled into outline of comic, and make animation. Because frame should be drew individually, so flat color is the best way to fill. </p><h2 id="Animation-and-Curve"><a href="#Animation-and-Curve" class="headerlink" title="Animation and Curve"></a>Animation and Curve</h2><p>How to make a animation? By hand, draw every frames, which is easily understand. But different frames count in 1 second will take different effect.</p><ul><li>6-7 frames/s <em>obviously lag</em>, for: <strong>stop motion</strong></li><li>12 frames/s <em>bascially smooth</em>, for: <strong>general animation</strong></li><li>24 frames/s <em>really smooth</em>, for: <strong>action expression / film</strong></li><li>60 frames/s <em>extremelly smooth</em>, for: <strong>game</strong></li></ul><p>It’s sooo hard to draw all frames by hand right?<br>Well, we have computer now, so how can it help artist to make aniamation then.</p><h3 id="Key-frames-animation"><a href="#Key-frames-animation" class="headerlink" title="Key frames animation"></a>Key frames animation</h3><p>Set 2 frames, and computer will generate other frames. It looks wonderful, but, not at all. Key frames only generate simple transform:</p><ul><li>translate</li><li>rotate</li><li>skew</li><li>scale</li></ul><p>For example, if I set two point, one is 0, another is 100. Then computer will generate graphic begin 0 to 100, but the graphic will not change except I set other animation. </p><p>In AE, we can also use <em>cursor</em> to build motion, moving cursor of a graphic will make it as if it be pull / drag, because this action will keep the original shape, so it looks like a organic motion. </p><h4 id="AE-expression-表达式"><a href="#AE-expression-表达式" class="headerlink" title="AE expression 表达式"></a>AE expression 表达式</h4><p>Imagine that, you want to let 5 ball move to right from left, <strong>one by one</strong>. The first thing you might inspire could be set different location of cursor on <strong>timeline</strong>, so they begin from different time. It’s OK, but, how about 100 balls, you can’t do that right, so we use expression.</p><p>AE expression is base on Javascript, we can use expression to get different values and set frames.</p><pre><code>transform.position + time * 100 * index</code></pre><ul><li><em>transform.postion</em> means this component ‘s current position</li><li><strong>time</strong> is the progress on timeline</li><li><strong>index</strong> is the index of layer</li></ul><p>This expression means this component will countinue move with time, and it will increase the distance with a higher layer.</p><h4 id="Bezier-curve"><a href="#Bezier-curve" class="headerlink" title="Bezier curve"></a>Bezier curve</h4><p>Computer is good at render geometric, but it can draw curve like human. So we should use Bezier curve to order computer to render a curve. </p><p>Bacially, Bezier curve can render by SVG and P5.js or other language. And it can be sorted as:</p><ul><li>Linear Bezier</li><li>Quadratic Bezier</li><li>Cubic Bezier</li></ul><p>Different Bezier should be applied different <strong>handle point</strong> to control the curve. Quadratic need 2 points, cubic 3. To move the handle point, we can control the motion of curve.</p><p>p5.js:</p><pre><code>shapeBegin()vertix(x,y);vertix(handleX,handleY);vertix(handleX2,handleY2);vertix(endX,endY);endShape()</code></pre><p>We can add more describe by add <strong>vertix()</strong> expression, it apply the coordition of a point to draw line. It is a good way to set point base on <strong>mouseX, mouseY</strong>, so computer will follow the user’s operation. If the motion should be set as automatically action, we can use <strong>frameCount</strong> , which will continue increase with timeline. Because the <em>framecount</em> will infinitve increase, so use cos(frameCount) to get a range of value from <strong>0 to 1</strong>. </p><p>If the handle point should move as a circle, we should get the function of circle, which return X and Y on a circle.</p><pre><code>let cX = x + r * cos(angle * PI / 180)let cY = y + r * sin(angle * PI /180)</code></pre><p>This is a function to get every point, when we set angle as framecount, this function will continue output coordinate of a circle, and we can use that to set value of <strong>handle of Bezier</strong>, it can move innifitve.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Think-about-population"><a href="#Think-about-population" class="headerlink" title="Think about population"></a>Think about population</h1><p>During before visual experiments, I began to think about the growth of population <del>in our planet</del>. As we know, we had have 6 billion population, and this count will increase dramatically  in future, as well as the problem from that.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="What’s-the-problem"><a href="#What’s-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="What’s the problem"></a>What’s the problem</h2><p>Does population make problem or improve industry? It depends. If this region have the ability to support suitable education / medical / insurgent, and the most important, the <strong>FOOD</strong>. Which probably means a rich region’s can generate more population with higher level than poor region. <em>It’s crude, but it is truth</em>. So it would be the problem.</p><h3 id="problem-in-poor-region"><a href="#problem-in-poor-region" class="headerlink" title="problem in poor region"></a>problem in poor region</h3><p>If compare the income or <strong>Disposable income</strong><a href="可支配收入">^1</a> with other region, the lowest level’s region could be seen as ‘poor region’. Pool region can’t support balanced / complete education for people, so they would want <em>have more children</em> , it is not a directly evidence or reason, but basically, the people who have high education would not be going to have 1 more children even 1 child.</p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/01/28/5c4f13dc0c82c.png" alt="Kim J. Female education and its impact on fertility"> [^2]</p><p>We can see this chart, in Japan, the <strong>birth rate</strong> was decline with the increase of <em>female education rate</em> it could evidence the effect of education rate on birth rate. Furthermore, in my country, pool region generally have a higher birth rate than other region, because in some countrysides, people need more population to join agricultural producing. So it made a <em>tradition</em>.</p><p><strong>Low education</strong> &amp; <strong>High birth rate</strong>, these factors might influence the security / environment.</p><p>In addition, some serious pool region can’t control the birth growth, might be the people have not enough contraception<a href="避孕">^3</a> concept / method, or some religion opinion influence them. So they could face food shortage.  </p><blockquote><p>“The problem is that less than 10 per cent of women in these countries are using modern contraception, a strong political commitment to a community-based approach to contraception can sharply slow population growth”</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5e31ea34-a517-11e3-8988-00144feab7de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bremner</a></p><p>To conclusion, pool region can’t hold a stable education, somewhere even can’t give enough food, but the birth rate was continually / uncontrollably increase.</p><h3 id="Problem-in-rich-region"><a href="#Problem-in-rich-region" class="headerlink" title="Problem in rich region"></a>Problem in rich region</h3><p>A rich region basically has a high productivity, but it even has a lower birth rate than poor region, even it has higher medical / education condition. But these positive point could be the reason lead low birth rate, <em>people don’t want to have children</em>. This reason can be easily understood, cause <del>children are tiny evils</del>. This phenomenon will lead a result, with the high productivity and low birth rate, the productivity and production will be <strong>excess</strong>, so rich countries will export their productivity to poor region. It might bring these effect:</p><h4 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h4><ol><li><strong>FOOD problem</strong> could be solved because of the help from rich countries.</li><li>The market can continue growth.</li><li>More work opportunities</li><li>Global progress improved the communication of culture.</li></ol><h4 id="disadvantages"><a href="#disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="disadvantages"></a>disadvantages</h4><ol><li>Local industry will collapse / distinct, even lose sovereignty<a href="主权">^4</a></li><li>Extreme export, such as Fascism</li><li>Capital bubble from Credit</li><li>Negative national competition</li></ol><h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h2><p>To analyse the phenomenon of population’s change, and base on current sciential / political context, I can suppose some theorems <a href="定理">^5</a> :</p><ol><li>Population will increase infinitively </li><li>Commercial / Education vs. Growth rate is in inverse proportion<a href="反比">^6</a></li><li>Productivity export to Poor region</li><li>Poor population immigrate to Rich region</li></ol><h2 id="Visualisation"><a href="#Visualisation" class="headerlink" title="Visualisation"></a>Visualisation</h2><p>It could be interesting to imitate the process of population growing by visuals graphic. I’m going to design a programme to imitate that with a specific algorithm which base on these theorems I supposed before. It might show the process of human communication and cultural mix.     </p><img src="/2019/01/28/Think-with-population/cut3.png"><img src="/2019/01/28/Think-with-population/cut.png"><img src="/2019/01/28/Think-with-population/cut2.png"><p>Here are some images I made, which use simple logic, but they can show the collection of groups, which have different colours and size, they are becoming bigger from edge to center.</p><pre><code>for(let i=1;i&lt;row;i++){// drawing element on row        for (let v = 1; v &lt; row; v++) {        // drawing element on vertical   s1.paper.circle(x,y,size)    }}</code></pre><p>The basic logic is using twice <em>For circulation</em>,to draw a matrix of points. </p><h3 id="More-details"><a href="#More-details" class="headerlink" title="More details"></a>More details</h3><p>During before experiment, I can guess the visuals form in this project. But the most attractive things are those supposition, I can make a range of motional graphics or animation or series of pictures to show the progress of population increase, base on random event but defined <strong>rate</strong>, can it imitate a kind of process of human multiply? What regular I can find, which I even haven’t set.</p><p><em>基于随机的事件和固定的概率，图形的发展和变化能体现出什么样的规律，它是否可以展示人类繁衍的潜在行为？</em></p><p>+++</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Trip-to-tate"><a href="#Trip-to-tate" class="headerlink" title="Trip to tate"></a>Trip to tate</h1><p>In this Friday, we went to the Tate modern museum to catch inspiration. Actually, I visited here twice, but this time is still gave me new ideas even something I didn’t understand.<br><a id="more"></a></p><h2 id="atmosphere-of-building"><a href="#atmosphere-of-building" class="headerlink" title="atmosphere of building"></a>atmosphere of building</h2><p>As a famous contemporary museum, Tate modern has a good design at interior design and architecture. We can see a clear structure in this building, and wall paint, sometimes the wall is original so it shows a concrete material or iron. In my view,  it can decrease the attraction of building so viewer can focus more on exhibitions.</p><h3 id="A-big-painting-on-ground"><a href="#A-big-painting-on-ground" class="headerlink" title="A big painting on ground"></a>A big painting on ground</h3><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate1.jpg"><p>I don’t know who is the man painted on ground XD, and I even don’t know it is a painting before I backed to upper floor. It is really big so people stand beside the painting are hard to fully view it. To more specific observe, it is paint as different points with different distance and size, it could be generated by Python or other programme. In the picture I took, there is a child is standing in the work, she might not know she has been surrounded by this art work, but this work indeed effected her. Is it the effect of art? It could be invisible or potential, but it does work.</p><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate2.jpg"><p>As well as atmosphere/ environment, it will not illustrate a specific meaning, but it effect on content and feeling. </p><h3 id="Light-and-Dark"><a href="#Light-and-Dark" class="headerlink" title="Light and Dark"></a>Light and Dark</h3><p>The Light &amp; Dark always can be the good tool for artists. It create strong visual to catch focus. </p><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate10.jpg"><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate3.jpg"><p>The motional text with bright light can easily get attention, and the artist used angle and bulb to create a triangle light.</p><p>And in this work,</p><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate7.jpg"><p>light generated sort of shadow which have different clarity, so it exhibit the change of hierarchy because of the distance between objects and light source.  </p><h3 id="Magic-of-materials"><a href="#Magic-of-materials" class="headerlink" title="Magic of materials"></a>Magic of materials</h3><p>Contemporary artist generally will not be limited by materials, they can show concept through any thing if it is possible. </p><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate8.jpg"><img src="/2019/01/19/Trip-to-Tate-Lecture-on-Friday/tate9.jpg"><p>I saw the upper one as a piece of soil which be lifted, so it could be understood as the remove of soil, and the conflict between nature and human. </p><p>Materials can take directly feeling which can guide viewer to associate with relative expression. Furthermore, it can combine with graphic language to improve visual effect.</p><h1 id="history-of-art"><a href="#history-of-art" class="headerlink" title="history of art"></a>history of art</h1><p>After trip in Tate, I joint a lecture which speak by Ben. He briefly talked about history of art. As a designer, I must admit I have not enough interests in fine arts and classical art. But I do like expressionism or abstractionism. </p><h2 id="the-progress-of-art"><a href="#the-progress-of-art" class="headerlink" title="the progress of art"></a>the progress of art</h2><p>Does idea being more important in art? Review the history of art, ideas and concepts look take more parts in an art work, some artist even gave traditional methods up to show their idea. </p><p>As a part of culture, art can be seen as the tool which convey ideology and attitude, so public require art become more expressive, especially during a war.</p><h2 id="Does-art-influence-a-War"><a href="#Does-art-influence-a-War" class="headerlink" title="Does art influence a War"></a>Does art influence a War</h2><p>The art work after war could be more popular for a collector, cause we can clear see the influence of war to the artist or society. But, can we find some work which <strong>effect</strong> a war? We see, some style such as Dada / Pop art, are influenced by war, they could be the result of war.</p><p>Futurism was popular in early 20th Centry Italy, it focus on expression of speed/ motion/ machine/ industry, in my view, it promote the increase of materialism in Italy.</p>]]></content>

In my opinion, this phenomenon is because of the change of <strong>marry</strong>. Children and children education is becoming kind of <strong>bear</strong> in a family especially in high-knowledge level group. More and more partner have strong individual concept, and they are becoming more <strong>independent</strong>.<br>So I want to explore the reason people become more independent with partner, it could be include the physical factors or emotional reason. </p>]]></content>

In the time, they will have different attitude to these sub-production as well as paintings. In today’s workshop, my peers created some experiments to express the process of misunderstanding and <strong>distortion</strong>.</p><h3 id="repeat-photocopy"><a href="#repeat-photocopy" class="headerlink" title="repeat photocopy"></a>repeat photocopy</h3><p>Photocopy a painting with 10 times, what does it look like? Digitally, pixel will increase, so it will lose details and sharpness. Furthermore, the colours will change to be more bright which have higher saturation. Fine lines will become bolder and look as if they’ve been <strong>engrave</strong> , because of lines look like rise up, and generate bigger contrast with background, so it has an engrave-alike texture.</p><h3 id="de-adjective"><a href="#de-adjective" class="headerlink" title="de-adjective"></a>de-adjective</h3><p>People generally describe and understand object through read adjective. A peer removed most adjectives in a text which describe the girl with pearl earring. Then she found it look as if it is describing Mona Lisa. It shows the influence of second-hand cognition, people will easily change the attitude because of different descriptions. So I thought we can see something in different angle, a general sight and illustratively.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Reflection-About-programming-and-concept-of-building-Web"><a href="#Reflection-About-programming-and-concept-of-building-Web" class="headerlink" title="Reflection: About programming and concept of building Web"></a>Reflection: About programming and concept of building Web</h1><p>Basically, I’ve finished this Web during this term. To summary, this Web is designed to devote translate words to graphic information. The content I used is Chinese classical poem, I catched poem by JSON which be supported by <a href="https://gushi.ci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gushi.ci</a>. <a id="more"></a>Therefore, user can get massive poem randomly, and they can try to understand it by graphic as well as the translation supported by Baidu’s API. Now, I’m going to conclude some problem I faced, and the final solution.</p><h2 id="use-Javascript-module-to-create-elements-in-time"><a href="#use-Javascript-module-to-create-elements-in-time" class="headerlink" title="use Javascript module to create elements in time."></a>use Javascript module to create elements in time.</h2><p>The target is showing a gallery on Web, there are many of image had been upload on cloud server, and display by <strong>href Link</strong>. I collected all of link in JSON file, and the Web can read link than create elements.</p><h3 id="module-style-and-Event"><a href="#module-style-and-Event" class="headerlink" title="module style and Event"></a>module style and Event</h3><p>As ECMA6 declared:</p><pre><code>$(&#39;body&#39;).append(`    &lt;p&gt;Content:${Variable}&lt;/p&gt;`)</code></pre><p>` (反引号) this symbol can include string and <strong>variable</strong>, which means it is easy to create module and generate elements on HTML.<br>The question is I should add event listener to elements for motion and interaction. After every new generations, I added event listener repeatedly, which means when user interact with that element, it will response many times! The original method is:</p><pre><code>Array.from(.elements).forEach((t)=&gt;{    t.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;,function(){        ...    })}) </code></pre><p>To add <strong>EL</strong> for every elements, I chose a <strong>class</strong>, and set to an <strong>Array</strong>, so it can use forEach() to <strong>iterate</strong> (遍历). <strong>But</strong>, the existed elements will be added EL again, which is horrible..So I changed the method of add, I chose the last element which is <strong>the last generated</strong>, and add EL for it. The important thing is <strong>Selector</strong>. </p><p>The SVG object can be chosen by CSS selector or DOM selector, so I would like to set attribute of SVG by <strong>Anime.js</strong> </p><pre><code>let cir = svg.paper.circle(x,y,r) //create circle elementcir.attr({    class:&#39;.cir-in-svg&#39;}) // set class so it can be chosen by CSS/Animeanime({    targets:&#39;.cir-in-svg&#39;,    translateX:[        {values:100,duration:1000,easing:&#39;linear&#39;},        {values:0,duration:1000,easing:&#39;linear&#39;}                ],    opacity:1,    duration:function(el,i,l){        return 500 + i*100  // el=targets,i=index,l=length    }})</code></pre><p>SVG can be set by CSS with a good performance and interactivity.  So in future work, my main direction will be vector graphic and interactive animation.</p><h3 id="add-a-random-item-from-existed-Array"><a href="#add-a-random-item-from-existed-Array" class="headerlink" title="add a random item from existed Array"></a>add a random item from existed Array</h3><p>This is a really usually requirement in WEB application, users could load more elements in time, but if every times they click and see <strong>same</strong> arrangement, there will not be cool. <code>There is a simple solution: create a new array, **random** select an element and push to new Array, then return the new one</code>, I thought. That’s wrong. Because it will add repeat elements, if randomly choose. So, the new solution is use Set type which declared by ECMA6, it like Array, can be iterated by for(..of..) The most important thing is : <strong>Set can not save same element</strong></p><pre><code>const originArr = [a,b,c,d,e]let ranSet = new Set()do {    ranSet.add(originArr[Math.floor(Math.random() * originArr.length)])} while (ranSet.size&lt;5);let    newArr = Array.from(ranSet)</code></pre><p>So, the newArray is the new Array which is absolutely random.</p>]]></content>

To definitely show the differences of characters, I chose <strong>Strokes counts</strong> to generate <strong>points and lines</strong>. In this article I will describe most progress and details.<br><a id="more"></a></p><h2 id="Point-amp-Line"><a href="#Point-amp-Line" class="headerlink" title="Point &amp; Line"></a>Point &amp; Line</h2><p>As my early experiments, the words were analysed and render as <strong>SVG shape</strong>, and these shapes are similar with real symbol of tone. It can clearly show the tone of words, but my expectation is not only show Tone of word. <strong>Individual elements should connect each other, as same as the composition of sentence is words.</strong> </p><p>To express <em>the composition of sentence</em>, I decided to use <strong>Lines</strong> as the format of compose. Which means every words will be translated to individual elements, and they connect and group as lines.</p><p>Now, I would like to remember the process of create lines.</p><h3 id="Thinking-process-methodology"><a href="#Thinking-process-methodology" class="headerlink" title="Thinking process/ methodology"></a>Thinking process/ methodology</h3><p><strong>Two points can be connected as a line.</strong> (两点一线)<br>It is really clear, a creation of line in computer, should have two points, and each point should be marked as X &amp; Y. Therefore, I should provide X1,X2,Y1,Y2 to draw a line in programmer.</p><pre><code>line(x1,y1,x2,y2)</code></pre><p>So, I tried to make groups of points, which base on <strong>Stroke of count</strong>.</p><h4 id="CCV-type-2"><a href="#CCV-type-2" class="headerlink" title="CCV type-2"></a>CCV type-2</h4><p>Here is the first outcome of <strong>Points</strong>, the quantity of points equal the strokes count of word.</p><img src="/2018/11/01/Reflection-Developing-CC-visualisaiton-T-3/photo1.jpg"><p>To be honest, it is really simple, even ugly. However, the only reason I did that is, I try to successfully create <strong>right</strong> counts of point. </p><h4 id="CCV-type-2-1"><a href="#CCV-type-2-1" class="headerlink" title="CCV type-2+"></a>CCV type-2+</h4><p>Next step, I connected every points, by lines.

Firstly, black is too <strong>thick</strong> when it shows on <strong>dense lines</strong>. Secondly, the order of points is too regular, so these lines create many sharp negative room, which make too strong contrast. So bad. 辣眼睛啊. </p><h4 id="CCV-type-3-Curve-Bezier-curve"><a href="#CCV-type-3-Curve-Bezier-curve" class="headerlink" title="CCV type-3. Curve! Bezier curve!"></a>CCV type-3. Curve!

Thank for great mathematicians,<del>(对不起，王老师，杨老师，熊老师我没学好数学)</del> we indeed have method to let computer render curve. One of that, is </strong>Bezier curve**. It means, we can set handles to control the curve of line.<br><a href="https://codepen.io/haydenhh/pen/dgQKMJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bezier Curve edit tool</a> </p><pre><code>bezierCurve(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4)//x2,y2;x3,y3; mean the points of handle.    </code></pre><img src="/2018/11/01/Reflection-Developing-CC-visualisaiton-T-3/photo2o.jpg"><h3 id="Decoration"><a href="#Decoration" class="headerlink" title="Decoration"></a>Decoration</h3><p>As MA IVM student, it is impossible to work without decoration. Actually, not only decoration, but also for better interaction and communication of user. In this step, I begin to consider the outlook of webpage, such as colour, layout, interaction and performance. </p><h4 id="colour"><a href="#colour" class="headerlink" title="colour"></a>colour</h4><p>I changed the colour of background to show more strong curves.</p><img src="/2018/11/01/Reflection-Developing-CC-visualisaiton-T-3/photo2.jpg"><img src="/2018/11/01/Reflection-Developing-CC-visualisaiton-T-3/photo3.jpg"><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r05qkt99ix1p1h0/TYPE-3Full.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download original image on Dropbox</a></p><h4 id="layout"><a href="#layout" class="headerlink" title="layout"></a>layout</h4><p>Currently, there are some questions need to develop:</p><ol><li>Input might be available to move with viewpoint, so user can preview the image when they are typing.</li><li>Button extremely need to improve!

In current stage, I want to use ‘Stroke’ to effect the <strong>format of graphic</strong>, which means how shapes group up and how they connect each other. The reason I thought is, Chinese word s sometimes have big differences in structure and strokes, it will effect visuals. The strokes will influence the <strong>complexity of the outlook, though it is irrelative to meaning generally, it can clear show different characteristics of words</strong></p><h4 id="Make-points-as-coordinate"><a href="#Make-points-as-coordinate" class="headerlink" title="Make points as coordinate"></a>Make points as coordinate</h4><p>I create a series of points by strokes count of each word, so every word will have some points which can be the <strong>coordinate</strong>. In future work, some specific shape could be set in the coordinate.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Reflection-Early-experiments-about-visualisation"><a href="#Reflection-Early-experiments-about-visualisation" class="headerlink" title="Reflection: Early experiments about visualisation"></a>Reflection: Early experiments about visualisation</h1><p>In this stage, I’ve done a prototype of visualisation application, it available user to support dynamic data and translate to geometric shape. I used JavaScript to build the application as well as NodeBox and illustrator. Then I will review the process of work.</p><h2 id="Source-of-idea"><a href="#Source-of-idea" class="headerlink" title="Source of idea"></a>Source of idea</h2><p>At first, we visited the V&amp;A museum, there are series of digital arts exhibited. I observed the layout and variant of graphic, but was confused by the irregular shape. I tired to find the reason and the meaning of artists want to convey. I failed.</p><p>这些数字渲染的作品充满了不确定性和随机性，但是不变的是他们的排列方式。艺术家用特殊的算法计算了图形的位置，并通过控制变量的方法让图形拥有不同的形状或者结构。</p><p>In M.Mohr’s work, I saw his algorithm generate shape as random symbol, they are ordered in grid system with a tiny translation of position. So I want to collect information and data as variable to generate more specific shape. I chose Chinese letter as the source of information, because Chinese letter can be separated to be different parts which have individual meanings.</p><h2 id="Work-process"><a href="#Work-process" class="headerlink" title="Work process"></a>Work process</h2><p>To complete my idea, it is important to <strong>distinguish</strong> the letter. I set a database, it will return the value of <strong>phonogram, stroke count, radical</strong> of letter whatever user type are( except special/strange word or symbol ).</p><p>After return of data, I used JS to analyse that and change the image which show on Web.</p><p>通过的采集的数据的分析，再遍历数据库，当有匹配对象的时候，返回它的详细信息，例如<strong>拼音，笔画和部首</strong>。 通过拆分返回的拼音字符串，再遍历每个字符串，与音调的数据库匹配，返回后即可以得到那个有音调的拼音所属于的音调。</p><img src="/2018/10/25/Reflection-Early-visualisation-of-Chinese/photo1.png"><p>Base on the tone of letters, specific shape will be set on Web. The method of render image is add and append tag in DOM as</p><pre><code> &lt;embed src=Dynamic link&gt;svg img&lt;/embed&gt;</code></pre><h2 id="Goodthing"><a href="#Goodthing" class="headerlink" title="Goodthing"></a>Goodthing</h2><p>To see a draft effect, I chose tone as variable to make graphic. I successful complete the logical stage (逻辑层面). Though it just show tone as characteristic of a word, it is easily to add more effect on shape. It clearly shows the differences of Chinese character which same as my first expectation</p><h2 id="Something-need-to-develop"><a href="#Something-need-to-develop" class="headerlink" title="Something need to develop"></a>Something need to develop</h2><h3 id="More-illustrative"><a href="#More-illustrative" class="headerlink" title="More illustrative"></a>More illustrative</h3><p>I used shape of symbol to show the tone of word, which is same as we daily use. But the final outcome should not be the showing  of symbol. The expression of tone might be a <strong>method/ structure</strong> when rendering shape. So, they the variable from tones should have the ability that show the change of tone/ level. <strong>Curve</strong> might be a good choice.</p><p>In future work, there will more information be add in graphic, but how should I keep a balance? What’s the composition of individual graphic? </p>]]></content>

Even in local communication, people could be confused when they talk with others who use different accent. There are so many accent in south of China, and they could use different tone in pronunciation system. </p><p>It is impossible to use geometric shape to represent word, but in this project, I want find <strong>commonness(共性）</strong> of parts of word, so I want to summarise the character of different tone in pronunciation, and how can I use graphic language to convey the meaning of parts of Chinese word.</p><h2 id="Characteristic-of-tone"><a href="#Characteristic-of-tone" class="headerlink" title="Characteristic of tone"></a>Characteristic of tone</h2><h3 id="Level-Tone"><a href="#Level-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Level Tone"></a>Level Tone</h3><p><em>Level Tone</em> is smooth and stable tone, but sometimes it decide the basic tone of a sentence.

Therefore, it could be a random colours in the begin of sentence.</p><h3 id="Rising-Tone"><a href="#Rising-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Rising Tone"></a>Rising Tone</h3><p>With the increasing of tone, the length of pronunciation is rise  too. So it is clearly that we could use Rising gradient colours to express that. On the other hand, it could give people the feeling of slow down because of the length of pronunciation is longer than other tone. So I might find some elements to convey the feeling of slow.</p><h3 id="Falling-Rising-Tone"><a href="#Falling-Rising-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Falling-Rising Tone"></a>Falling-Rising Tone</h3><p>It a change of direction. The first idea is <strong>contrast colours</strong>  to represent this tone. Such as the contrast Hue, lightness of colours.</p><h3 id="Falling-Tone"><a href="#Falling-Tone" class="headerlink" title="Falling Tone"></a>Falling Tone</h3><p>It should be quick and heavy. When people pronounciate falling tone, they generally emphasise the stress of word, a falling tone could have strong emotion and expression. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Thinking-about-Variables"><a href="#Thinking-about-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Thinking about Variables"></a>Thinking about Variables</h1><p>In digital creation, variable could be really important. It is generally used to replace a value, which could change between different individuals.<a id="more"></a> Such as colours, size, position, count, ratio, etc… It makes work looks various and interesting <del>(我真不知道丰富的英文怎么写)</del>. So, the topic is, why we use variable in design rather then fixed value, and does ‘random’ really interested user?</p><h2 id="Method-of-making-a-dynamic-art-work"><a href="#Method-of-making-a-dynamic-art-work" class="headerlink" title="Method of making a dynamic art work"></a>Method of making a dynamic art work</h2><p>The word ‘dynamic’ here means something could change easily and quickly. For example, Photoshop might be the best friend of us <del>no🙃</del>, the ‘smart object’ could be used in a high frequency. It can show the graphic as one layer, which could be combine with multiply layer. The useful thing is, it can be adjusted on the root layer, and its child layer can be easily changed, and effect on root. The only reason I mention that is, smart object could be seen as a component, a variable, it is really efficient in our creation, even it can be creative.</p><h3 id="Symbol-in-AI"><a href="#Symbol-in-AI" class="headerlink" title="Symbol in AI"></a>Symbol in AI</h3><p><del>No more Adobe!!!</del> Well, as a designer, Symbol in Illustrator could be useful. It available artist set a symbol, and draw many symbol with different colours, size, angle of rotate, density. When we draw symbol on a satisfied position, we could refine the  shape of symbol. Really useful.</p><h3 id="Javascript-in-HTML"><a href="#Javascript-in-HTML" class="headerlink" title="Javascript in HTML"></a>Javascript in HTML</h3><p>So many nonsense I wrote before, the only thing I want to say is <del>好像已经说过一次这话了</del> Variable or dynamic data is a model of work. We should manage well the relationship between different parts of component in project. For me, JS give me possibilities to change the outlook of Web, even available me make interaction for user and supply dynamic visual.</p><h3 id="nodeBox"><a href="#nodeBox" class="headerlink" title="nodeBox"></a>nodeBox</h3><p>NodeBox is a powerful tool to create dynamic graphic. It have a GUI face, so we can edit data with clear, simple way. In this work, I tried to use variable as ratio of shape, that means every shape would be created with a random way, but it keep a dynamic ratio, so it shows a motion of graphic.</p><img src="/2018/10/22/Think-about-Variable-in-art-creation/photo1.gif"><p>In this picture, these square are created with a dynamic ratio, the ratio was set as a Sin function, the value changed with frames. As we know, the min value of Sin() is <strong>-1</strong>， the max one is <strong>1</strong>, so the value will be a loop. <del>我爱数学数学爱我(no)</del><br>The interesting thing is, if I change even really small value of variable, it will make totally different visual language. </p><img src="/2018/10/22/Think-about-Variable-in-art-creation/photo2.gif"><h3 id="NodeBox-PS-AE"><a href="#NodeBox-PS-AE" class="headerlink" title="NodeBox + PS/AE"></a>NodeBox + PS/AE</h3><p>Nodebox can create random shape easily, it support the dynamic shape and variable can be changed. Furthermore, the shape can be rendered as frames, so they can be used as video. I created motion graphic in NodeBox, and translate to GIF image by PS. PS can quickly adjust layout and colours of elements, so it is possible to make digital poster by variable and motion graphic.</p><img src="/2018/10/22/Think-about-Variable-in-art-creation/photo3.gif"><h2 id="The-value-of-variable-for-a-design"><a href="#The-value-of-variable-for-a-design" class="headerlink" title="The value of variable for a design"></a>The value of variable for a design</h2><p>It’s no debt that it is difficult to control a variable, but it indeed support more possibilities for artist. Firstly, a dynamic design have more style, which can give <strong>unpredictable effect</strong>; Secondly, variable generally available user to interact with elements or interface, and visual could change when user give different operation, so it support interesting <strong>interactive</strong> experience; Thirdly, flexible variable can suit custom of user, such as change layout base on user’s <strong>devices, location, time and language</strong>. </p>]]></content>

But the important thing for me is, how to keep a positive attitude to do research, which means we should <strong>enjoy</strong> the process of research rather then complete an assignment. </p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/fiona_grady" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiona</a> said,</p><blockquote><p>the research in social media can improve the confidence of artists because they can get constructive feedback and gain more friends which have same interests.</p></blockquote><p>For me, do research on social media could not be a good idea because I generally be attracted by other things. The point I absolutely agree is that we should gain confidence and pleasure in the process of research. It might improve my <strong>ambition</strong> to realise new things or accept something I hadn’t agreed or understood. </p><h2 id="how-do-we-do-research-in-a-happy-experience"><a href="#how-do-we-do-research-in-a-happy-experience" class="headerlink" title="how do we do research in a happy experience?"></a>how do we do research in a happy experience?</h2><p>It’s no doubt that people always glad to do something might make self <strong>happy </strong>. To make self be happy, we should focus on something we interested. Unfortunately, sometimes the topic of subject could not the favourite one, even some theories are serious and boring. <em>how can we change the attitude and be more excited in process of research?</em>  In my view, the key is <strong>synchronise with experiment</strong>. That’s means, when we are doing  research, we should do some experiments and sketch or mind-map, so we can see the process of our thinking and understanding, we might get clear understanding, and it the <strong>result or outcome</strong> could make us be more confident, rather then a dozen of paper, so boring, isn’t it.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Research-about-Manfred-Mohr"><a href="#Research-about-Manfred-Mohr" class="headerlink" title="Research about Manfred Mohr"></a>Research about Manfred Mohr</h1><p>Manfred Mohr is a pioneer of digital art. I saw his work in V&amp;A museum. His attitude for computer generated art is convincing and similar with me.<br><a id="more"></a></p><p>As he said,</p><blockquote><p>I write computer algorithms i.e. rules that calculate and then generate the work which could not be realized in any other way. My artistic goal is reached when a finished work can dissociate itself from its logical content and stand convincingly as an independent abstract entity.</p></blockquote><p>Data and algorithms could be visualize, and computer can operate thousands of programmer to render the image that definitely hard to draw by hand. In addition, Mohr thought about the deeper form of digital art. His algorithms can render shape by particular way and <strong>create</strong> new composition of shape which means every elements exist in work could be different in composition and any other details. <strong>LOOKS COMPUTER COULD BE THINKING</strong>. Actually computer can’t thinking now, it merely doing something that have been set, but it can control variable to make every elements have tiny differences.</p><h2 id="Early-work"><a href="#Early-work" class="headerlink" title="Early work"></a>Early work</h2><blockquote><p>My early artistic work was influenced by <strong>atonal music</strong>, modern Jazz and <strong>abstract expressionism</strong>. As a consequence, geometry and the reduction of my visual vocabulary to black and white as binary decisions, took more and more importance in my work after 1963. </p></blockquote><p>As he said, he was inspired by atonal music and expressionism. It is really interesting, for me, music and expressionism both are emotional and abstract objects which are hard to describe by words or logical. But Mohr expressed these objects by computer, which have strict ruler and grammar in programmer. So, there is strong contrast in his work, because <strong>he used rational object convert to abstract information</strong>.</p><p>Here are some early test of work and experiment of him:</p><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo1.jpg"><ul><li>(Photo1) In this work, I can find his intention of express music and <strong>atone</strong>. To convey the unregulated and unordered tone, he drew some crooked border lines to represent tone in stave. I can guess it could the reason he used computer to draw random objects. In his drawing, I can see the difficulty of drawing absolutely random things, <strong>at most time we draw something with the order of brain, and the order generally is informative and conceive</strong>. </li></ul><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo2.jpg"><ul><li><p>(Photo2) This work showed a construction of lines. A nylon stocking is tear up and put on board. It shows different density of lines and negative space. To control the density of order, repeat and innocence thing can convey specific information.</p></li><li><p>In 1969-1972, Mohr began to design algorithms to express his work. Image was printed by <strong>plotter</strong> which can be controlled by algorithm. </p></li></ul><blockquote><p>A number of printer control languages were created to operate pen plotters, and transmit commands like “lift pen from paper”, “place pen on paper”, or “draw a line from here to here”. Three common ASCII-based plotter control languages are Hewlett-Packard’s HP-GL, its successor HP-GL/2 and Houston Instruments DMPL. Here is a simple HP-GL script drawing a line :</p></blockquote><pre><code>SP1;PA500,500;PD;PR0,1000;PU;SP;</code></pre><blockquote><p>This program instructs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plotter</a>, in order, to take the first pen (SP1 = Select Pen 1), to go to coordinates X=500, Y=500 on the paper sheet (PA = Plot Absolute), to lower the pen against the paper (PD = Pen Down), to move 1000 units in the Y direction (thus drawing a vertical line - PR = Plot Relative), to lift the pen (PU = Pen Up) and finally to put it back in its stall.</p></blockquote><p>As we can see, early plotter has strict ruler and logical grammar. It should be given some order and parameter to draw image. </p><p><strong>data and parameter could convert to informative shape</strong>,<br><strong><em>can shape or words return to data? So it might be reconstructed and convey new means?</em></strong></p><p>In this idea, Chinese word could be dissociated to different stroke, pronunciation, stress and <strong>component</strong> which group up a word. In Chinese word, there are <strong>4 stresses</strong> in pronunciation ruler, and most of character components (PianPang) have specific meanings, thats means, a Chinese word can <strong>be separated to be different words and meaning</strong>. Though it will <strong>lose the accuracy expression</strong>, it still convey part of original meaning and excess meaning. In later day, I would do deeper research about separation of Chinese character.</p><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo3.png"><ul><li>(photo3) This work is made from vertical and horizon line, the horizon one is thicker so we can clear see that continuous line changed the direction. Actually the trace of line is <strong>random</strong> and controlled by algorithms. <em>how long it go straight, how it change direction, when?</em> The algorithms operate plotter to draw this image. It could be really interesting if we printed hundreds of it, the random walk of line, like a creature, smart and fool. </li></ul><img src="/2018/10/15/Research-about-M-Mohr/photo4.gif"><ul><li>(photo4) Random and variable can make complex composition, there are infinitive possibilities can be render, but the ruler is not changed, and the visual grammar is both same. In this point, the shape merely as a outcome, <strong>the algorithms could be art finally</strong>. <em>A designer do not just create shape, it support a ruler, a model, a code</em>.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The elements are horizontal, vertical, 45 degree lines, square waves, zig-zags, and have probabilities for line widths and lengths.<br>In each position on a very dense imaginary matrix, a sign is composed from 0-7 elements from the above alphabet.<br>When 0 lines are chosen, a circle can be drawn having a randomly chosen radius and center.</p></blockquote><p>An image system in film could be made from similar elements, such as shape, structure and colours. These things combine with each other in an obscure (not obvious) way, but it indeed support a feeling or <strong>key</strong> that make all of elements connected. In addition, it makes association, because its <em>ruler, grammar, way of composition</em>. <a href="https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/film-technique-how-a-master-uses-image-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using of image system in film factory</a></p><p><strong>Similar with image system, a computer-generated image could be made from series of elements which could be really simple, they group up with specific layout, and changed size or width, etc..</strong></p>]]></content>

Though I contacted screen printing before, heres tutor gave us many useful information.<br><a id="more"></a></p><h2 id="Steps-to-print"><a href="#Steps-to-print" class="headerlink" title="Steps to print"></a>Steps to print</h2><ul><li><p>The first step is clear the table and prepare a <strong>laysheet</strong>. That’s the paper we would print as outcome. And we must bring <strong>original work</strong>. We should place the original work to comfirm the position we print on laysheet. So we paste work (it generally is acid paper) Fixed by tape. Than we fix film board on print machine so it hard to move. A little tip is fold a paper and paste on laysheet, so it is available to move and adjust to a right position though the sheet will be covered by film board.</p></li><li><p>The ink should be adjust to be wet and smooth that’s means it will not dry too quick. To confect (调制) a good quality ink, we should balance the ratio of <strong>acrylic medium</strong> and <strong>acrylic</strong>. Medium should be put into container at first, because it can available acrylic mixed completely. <strong>50%</strong> medium and about 10g acrylic, and tiny other colours if we nee d mixed colour. <del>其实就挤三四陀就好了。</del> </p></li><li><p>To print well, we should print ink equality, <strong>DO NOT</strong> print overly, it lose all of details of engraving. The most important thing is that if we print a multicolour work, the position of laysheet should be accuracy place. We use first work that took mark with laystops to  guarantee that. </p></li></ul><h2 id="Why-use-screen-printing"><a href="#Why-use-screen-printing" class="headerlink" title="Why use screen printing?"></a>Why use screen printing?</h2><p>Screen printing is a technique that print something have original details. Though it could print repeatedly, every times printing with different speeds or force might make different effect. </p><p>Furthermore, the making of film board could be hand drawn that’s means some hand drawn illustrations can be use as film, and print to different colors. Different with digital creation, the process of making film could have tiny differences between original painting, so it will full of unpredictable details that really gorgeous for me.</p>]]></content>

As designers, we generally use computer everyday, it is hard to imagine that how can I work when I leave computer.<a id="more"></a>  Did computer really support us to make incredible work? Is it <strong>REALLY VITAL THING</strong> in creation process? Or we merely rely on convient drawing or storage? It could make sence to understand early computer work and relieze how early computer artists thinking about art.</p><p>In the early computer generated work, most of work could be made by mathematician or scientists, because they should operate complex progremmer on computer. Sometimes they did works with random shape or regular form, which could not be defined to an art work. If we focus on their process of working, we can find that they are trying to make computer to create something that generally repeat and change with some variable.</p><img src="/2018/10/12/V-A-Classical-digital-work/photo.jpg"><p>As Manfred <strong>Mohr said</strong>, </p><blockquote><p>it is more important that develop a priori vocabulary which integrates the computer into the aesthethic system.</p></blockquote><p>As a tool, computer can make really fine image with actually a easy way. The more difficult thing is that how can we make computer create image as a <strong>CREATOR</strong>? That’s means computer should have the ability to create image that does’t create by hand. In fact, computer would ever create something from <strong>ZERO</strong>. It must opearte with some programmer that set by artist. In Manfred’s work, I saw some shape grouped with some specific method. These shape will be no sense if anyone out from group, and if they set in a matrix, we can see the visual grammer of work. Artist set a way that computer can create polyline and circle, and the quantity of point or length of line could be <strong>random</strong>, so every shape will have tiny differents but shows amazing variety.</p><img src="/2018/10/12/V-A-Classical-digital-work/photo2.jpg"><p>In this work, letters are printed as a strict format, like frame in frame. Computer always render some info from data bank by specific method, and the exsit of data could be visualization. Analyze the attribute or quantity of data, and render to more clear visual information. For illustration, artist could use tiny elements to make a bigger group, we collect different essential elements to imitate some situation and environment.</p><img src="/2018/10/12/V-A-Classical-digital-work/photo3.jpg">]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discuss-with-research"><a href="#Discuss-with-research" class="headerlink" title="Discuss with research"></a>Discuss with research</h2><p>As an academic skill, research is the vital thing in my study process. In the begin of term, critical thinking and research have been the most important subject. Indeed, research for me was really helpful in the past projects.<br><a id="more"></a><br>I collected others’ ideas and method to seek possibilities in my own work. Evenmore, research could be a tool that understand others’ opion or attitude. That’s means, a work developed by research, it might be more acceptable, because some parts of it were inspired from existent theories and knowledges.</p><p>One of classmates do research by experience and travel real location to feel atmosphere. It would be more sensetive if we go somewhere and observe local objects. Not only take photos, but find out some details in building, environment and human culture. If we want to realize somewhere, it is a good way to stay there, merely do nothing. In my view, doing research not just take notes or sketch something, keeping thinking and being relax could be useful to inspired self.</p><p>Another classmates said a question that always confused me that sometimes we usually don’t know <strong>WHY</strong> did we choose some colours in our work. Sometimes, we indeed like do somtings we would like to do, which without reasons. Evenmore, we found more evidence to demonstrate that. Although it could be a way to develop work, it is still not reasonable. As a designer, we should know the reason we choose some layout or colours, it can be logical and linear. So it is important to draft our project, when we have some satisfied scheme, <em>we should do more research and realize why it is good</em>, so we will get more clear mind to develop that. 🌚</p><p>Finally, somebody showed her FMP for us. They are some engraving works with gorgeous texture. And she pointed some special texture was created by <strong>ACCIDENT</strong> which made because of something broken. Fortunately, this accident made a really good shape with powerful trace. Charley said, </p><blockquote><p>we call it <strong>LUCKY ACCIDENT</strong> </p></blockquote><p>😂😂😂 Is it means art need luck? Of course <strong>NO!</strong> The lucky girl said, she used some bad outcome which printed with unsatisfied texture, she developed by cut and refine the outline. She distinguished the quality of work, and did action research, so she could create better work than early one. <strong><em>Face own lose, find the reason than refine that</em></strong> Maybe reason could be the most important thing when we creating work, and research can help us to define the reason we choose.</p><p>Cheers.</p>]]></content>

At first, I cant believe that there are both digital work when I saw the date of creation. I said,</p><blockquote><p>it looks like a digital work!</p></blockquote><p>Of course they are, they definitely are, and they are the pioneer of digital arts! Cool!</p><img src="/2018/10/09/First-day-in-V-A/IMG_6763.JPG"><p>As Colette saids,</p><blockquote><p>“Grass is random and random is a natural computer facility. Computer grass is natural grass”(1980)</p></blockquote><p>Computer is really good at doing something random and repeat . It can do some thing repeatedly during hundred of thousand times, so something complex can be produce which could be a nightmare if did by someone. Random is beautiful, especially something changed with some regular. Something might be interesting because of tiny differences, that’s why some illustrators fall into creating some texture or brush-stroke. Some random variable can be set in computer and used to create delicate shape with thousands of possibilities.</p><p>Next time, I might create some work about variable. As a future illustrator, I should use these variable or shape to convey some specific information. Popularity? Geography? Traffic? Whatever they are, a contemporary illustration work should support clearer meaning. Advanced animation technic and colours display could be my good tool to use.</p><p>Cheers, for ancient computer and pioneers of digital arts.!</p>]]></content>
